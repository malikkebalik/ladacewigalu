He is just special as he moved from NXT to the main roster and straight up went against the top dog, <a href=#>John Cena</a>, to beat him for the US title. And since, Owens has been a regular and is always given a spot at Wrestlemania. Kevin Owens is special for various reasons. Whether he plays a heel or a babyface, he is just as impressive with his mic skills and creative manuevers. Since coming to the main roster, it’s only been once that Owens has missed the main event, at Wrestlemania. KO has found a way to stand out and steal the show regardless of the competition or requirement, whether it’s for championship gold or bitter rivalries. Thanks to deliberate buildups leading up to the event, he has absolutely made it his own. So, let’s go through Kevin Owens’ top three Wrestlemania bouts.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-646 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-869 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Wrestlemania 32 – Kevin Owens vs. Sami Zayn vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. Sin Cara vs. Stardust vs. The Miz vs. Zack Ryde (Intercontinental Championship Ladder Match)</h2><p>Kevin Owens made his debut appearance at WrestleMania 32. In a seven-man ladder match, KO fought to defend&nbsp;the Intercontinental Championship. <a href=#>Sami Zayn</a>, Stardust, Sin Cara, Dolph Ziggler, Zack Ryder, and <a href=#>The Miz</a> were his opponents. In the curtain-raiser, they got WrestleMania off to a fast start. The fact that the bout was centred around KO and Zayn was also a plus. Owens landed a frog splash on Zayn, who was lying down on a ladder. KO was moaning in agony, yet he demonstrated his skills as the reigning champion. Furthermore, KO threw Sin Cara off the Stardust-launching ladder, causing the ladder to break. Despite this, Owens was on the verge of regaining the Intercontinental Championship when Zayn stepped in and intervened, removing him from the situation. Ryder took advantage of Miz’s fall from grace and won the Intercontinental Championship.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>READ MORE: <a href=#>Aj Styles’ top 3 Wrestlemania matches</a></p><h2>WrestleMania 33 – Kevin Owens Vs. Chris Jericho</h2><p>At WrestleMania 33, Kevin Owens challenged <a href=#>Chris Jericho</a>, his longtime tag team partner, for the United States title gold. It was&nbsp;an absolute masterpiece and&nbsp;was one of the more entertaining matches on the schedule.&nbsp; Their encounter was back-and-forth, with both players having periods of control. Jericho was on the verge of reclaiming the United States Championship, but Owens refused to go down. Owens pinned Jericho with a pop-up powerbomb on the ring apron to win the United States Championship for the first time in his career. Regrettably, <a href=#>Mr. McMahon</a> was not pleased with the match, and was&nbsp;reprimanded.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-637 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>WrestleMania 36 – Kevin Owens Vs. Seth Rollins</h2><p>Kevin Owens and Seth Rollins are without a doubt two of WWE’s top wrestlers right now. At WrestleMania 36, they effectively had two bouts in one. This contest deserved to be watched by a large crowd, but COVID-19 had other plans. The bouts between Rollins and Owens are always intriguing, and they hit a home run in yet another fantastic match between the two former WWE World Champions. Rollins was disqualified after slamming a ring bell into Owens. KO, on the other hand, did not want to win in this fashion, thus the bout was resumed under the NO DQ rules. Owens was violently beaten by the Vissionary, who fired six stiff steel chair shots at him. KO rebounded and used the ring bell to attack Rollins. Owens hurling himself off the WrestleMania sign and putting Rollins through the announce table was the highlight of this brutal battle. Both men were in poor shape, but Owens regained his composure, and the Stunner was sufficient for KO to win.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2Ftb%2FLrqSoZpOkunDD1p5mpJ2mnrtuu9aepaxlpKS9bn%2BMsKmeq6Shsq6tzaKYZqWRqbCpsdJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
