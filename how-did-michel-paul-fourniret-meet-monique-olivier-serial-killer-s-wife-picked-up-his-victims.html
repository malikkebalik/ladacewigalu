The couple met at a prison gate when Fourniret was released after serving a <a href=# rel>sexual assault</a> sentence in the 1980s.</p><p>Fourniret confessed to killing 11 women from 1987 to 2003 and his wife Olivier, whose horrifying story is featured in Netflix's ‘Monique Olivier: Accessory to Evil', helped Fourniret fulfill his sick needs. She went around in her car to pick up the victims - women and girls aged between 12 and 22 - with their young son Selim Fourniret in the back seat. Fourniret's <a href=# rel>female victims</a> were Isabelle Laville, Fabienne Leroy, Jeanne-Marie Desramault, Elisabeth Brichet, Natacha Danais, Celine Saison, Mananya Thumphong, Farida Hammiche, and Marie-Angèle Domèce, reports <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">BBC.</a> Estelle Mouzin, Fourniret's youngest victim, was <a href=# rel>murdered</a> in 2003. She was just nine.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Jennifer Anne Hall: 'Serial killer' nurse accused of killing 9 patients is charged with another murder</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Who was Mad Butcher aka Cleveland Torso Murderer? Stockton serial killer compared to 1930s mass murderer</a></p><h2 class=split>How did Michel Paul Fourniret meet Monique Olivier?</h2><p>Olivier responded to an ad Fourniret placed looking for a pen pal, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Guardian</a>. Fourniret, who worked as a draughtsman, electrician, carpenter, and even a supervisor in a Belgian school, was in jail for a sexual assault. Letters seized by investigators showed that Olivier and Fourniret made a pact in 1987 when he was released from prison. According to the pact, if he killed her first husband, who she claimed had abused her, she would help him find young virgins. The list included Joanna Parrish, a 20-year-old Leeds University language student who was found dead in a river in Auxerre in 1990, as per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">BBC.</a></p><h2 class=split>Details about Michel Paul Fourniret</h2><p>Fourniret was detained by Belgian police on June 26, 2003, after his alleged bungled kidnapping of a 13-year-old girl, as per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Journeyman.</a> In the 2008 trial, he was convicted of seven of the killings. He died in 2021 after suffering from heart problems and mental degeneration, as per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Mirror.</a> Following Fourniret's death, Richard Delgene, Olivier's lawyer, said, "Michel Fourniret is taking his secrets with him. As we still have a lot of cases in progress, Monique Olivier will remain the only one in the defendants’ box to be held accountable." Currently, Olivier is serving a 28-year sentence for her involvement in five of her husband’s murders, reports <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Express.</a></p><h2 class=split>'My parents are dead'</h2><p>In 2018, Fourniret and Olivier's son Selim Fourniret spoke about his parents. “Selim Fourniret no longer exists. My parents are dead," he said, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Get To Text.</a> "Now it's Monique Olivier and Michel Fourniret. They are two strangers.” He also spoke about his father. “He often got angry over trifles, never physical violence, just screaming, verbal violence. He was very bossy. I even wanted Monique more than Michel because we had a bond, she and I. If the relatives of the victims manage to forgive them, I will be able to do so. But as it will not be possible, I will not be able,” he said at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRooJ%2BseqW1w2akopuYmrluvMCuo2aen6q%2Fr7XRnqtmpZWawW65zqegqq2VYryttdWinKtlo5q%2Fqq3LZqKipJyav7R51qKdnmWgnrCsscNmrKllmJ7AbsLInKuipaM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
