"Saw Chelsea Handler on the big screen and obvi googled the two of them. Then saw him kiss a blonde next to him (she is masked, so it's hard to tell)."</p><p>Besides enjoying his time with his rumored girlfriend, Koy also threw the first pitch at the start of the game, as&nbsp;seen in his <a href=# rel=follow>Instagram</a> post.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>On September 2, he shared a video featuring various clips from the game day, and multiple shots saw the couple close to each other. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The 50-year-old had also grammed a selfie of himself and&nbsp;Handler, where she put her head over his shoulder.
