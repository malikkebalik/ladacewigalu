The jury sentence came after just two hours of deliberations — and one day after Guyger, 31, was convicted of murder in Dallas County court for the 26-year-old’s Sept. 6, 2018 shooting death.
Jean’s younger brother, Brandt, shared a lengthy courtroom embrace with his sibling’s killer after the sentence was handed down."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I want the best for you because I know that’s exactly what Botham would do,” Brandt said in a victim-impact statement after the sentencing. “I don’t know if this is possible but can I give you a hug? Please?”</p><p>The defense argued that the ex-cop feared Jean was an intruder when she barged into his unlocked apartment, mistaking it for of her own pad one floor below.</p><p>“We know by the verdict that it was an unreasonable mistake, but it was still a mistake,” defense attorney Toby Shook said Wednesday in closing statements. “She didn’t go there trying to kill him. It was the last thing on her mind.”</p><p>Prosecutors, however, claimed that her defense was “absurd” and questioned how she missed the signs that she was in the wrong apartment.</p><p>Guyger faced a sentence of 5 to 99 years in prison for the murder charge. Before the guilty verdict was handed down, she elected for the jury to decide her sentence.</p><p>The prosecution asked the jury hand the fired cop no less than a 28-year sentence.</p><p>“This is not a five, 10 or 15-year case. Botham didn’t provoke his own death,” Prosector LaQuita Long said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnp7kGlmaWpfmsVusMClo5qrXZi8sXnAppmeql2cwrqzxKtkrJ2eqbKvr8SdZK2nXWZ9bsXEmqmsZZmjerG%2ByKymp2WWpL9urs6tn5qlXZ%2ByorqMpqyrnJWnfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
