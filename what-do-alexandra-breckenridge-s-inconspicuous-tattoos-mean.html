But even if you have followed her through these smash hit shows, you might not have noticed the actress’ few tattoos on different parts of her body.
Not only are Breckenridge’s inks in inconspicuous places, but she also usually covers them up when acting. That is because the characters she inhabited were not the tattooed type."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The triskelion is a symbol of continuous movement.</p><p>It represents life and death, eternal life and rebirth, and the three spirals stand for the mind, body, and spirit, as well as the past, present, and future. This body art proves that Breckenridge has a spiritual side, and that she puts a lot of thought into her body ink.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Another visible body ink the actress has is of a fairy, most likely a pixie, given the pointy ear. Breckenridge is probably trying to express her whimsical side, as fairy tattoos are usually associated with magic and playfulness.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>And lastly, the actress has a spider on her toes. It is unclear what species the spider is, but the most common spider tattoo people get&nbsp;is of a black widow that represents a strong and confident woman.&nbsp;</p><h2>Alexandra Breckenridge’s Husband Is a Tattoo Aficionado&nbsp;</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Breckenridge is not the only tattoo enthusiast in the family. Her husband, Casey Hopper, also has many tattoos on his body.</p><p>For the unversed, Hopper is the lead guitarist for <a href=# rel=follow>Katy Perry</a>'s&nbsp;band. In 2019, he posted a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">photo</a> of his new eagle&nbsp;tattoo, which&nbsp;he got with his bandmates.&nbsp;He did not explain the reason behind getting the matching ink, but an eagle represents opportunities in tattoo culture.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>This probably means the bandmates were celebrating new opportunities or hoping for more.&nbsp;</p><p>That was the only time he mentioned his tattoo openly. Other times, like his wife, the guitarist prefers&nbsp;to cover his body marks with sleeved shirts.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmcmsWiusOrmGaaopqwrLHNq6Cdn5ViwaLA06imrGaYqbqt</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
