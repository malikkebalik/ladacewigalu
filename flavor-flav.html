Roosevelt, a New York native has kept his personal life out of the spotlight in recent years, but when he went on Steve Harvey’s talk program in May 2016, he revealed a few pieces of information about his marriage.</p><p>While Flavor has kept a low-key lifestyle, many were concerned about his marriage to Liz Trujillo. As a result, he revealed that he and his wife are still together and provided details about his married life.</p><p>Flavor released the information in a May 2016 interview, saying,</p><p>“You know what I’m talking about? My son Karma is nine years old right now. My girl, on the other hand, is at home, just chilling. But, yeah, after twelve years, we’re still together. Do you understand what I’m saying? As a result, I’m not enraged.”</p><p>Flavor and Liz are happy in their marriage, though they had a tough period in the past. When they were still engaged, the couple appeared on VH1’s Couple’s Therapy in 2013.</p><p>Liz admitted on the show that the time when she realized Flav had signed a contract for a dating show without his girlfriend’s knowledge was the low point in their relationship.</p><h3>Learn More About Azealia Banks’ Life: Boyfriend, Dating, Gay, and Net Worth</h3><p>Flavor’s then-wife recounted how she learned about Flavor’s new show in a June 2013 interview, saying,</p><p>“We had been in a serious relationship for eight months when we were in a deli and the gentleman said, ‘Congratulations Flav, on your new show and finding true love and dating 25 beautiful ladies.’ ‘A new program, what?’ I said as I gazed at him. What’s up with that? Do you want to find your true love? “I’m not sure what you’re talking about.”</p><p>Liz Trujillo, Flavor Flav’s fiancé, fell during the taping of VH1’s Couples Therapy in April 2013 and was hospitalized after overdosing on painkillers. “The claim of an overdose, or any participation of narcotics, could not be further from the truth,” Flavor’s spokeswoman said.</p><h2>Flavor Flav’s Jail Visit</h2><p>In October 2012, Flavor chased his then-fiancee, Liz’s son, Karma, with a kitchen knife at Flavor’s Las Vegas home, causing further damage to the couple’s relationship.</p><p>In the year 2000, he was living in a difficult area near Yankee Stadium in the Bronx apartment of his then-girlfriend, Beverly Johnson (together with her two children from a previous relationship).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/uploads/images/celebrity/Flavor%20Flav%2C%20Karma%20Drayton%2C%20Liz%20Trujillo%20and%20Gibran%20Trujillo.jpg><p>According to sources from April 2014, Flavor acknowledged threatening him, for which he would have been sentenced to 12 years in prison on felony assault charges, but the court lowered the charges to misdemeanor offenses at the last minute after Flav reconnected with his family.</p><p>The Clark County District Court sentenced him to probation and four months of domestic violence counseling.</p><p>Despite having been through some difficult times in the past, the couple has triumphed and is still going strong as a relationship.</p><h2>Flavor Flav’s Previous Marriages And Relationships</h2><p>Flav was formerly married to Karen Ross, with whom he had three children. Following the marriage, Flave married Angie Parker, his second wife.</p><h3>Also read: Pooch Hall Arrested For DUI And Abuse; Faces Years In Prison</h3><p>Flavors have six children with both of his wives: Shaniq Drayton, Quanah Drayton, Jasmine Drayton, Dazyna Drayton, and William Drayton.</p><p>The flavor is also the father of seven children since he shares his youngest son Karma with his wife, Liz Trujillo.</p><p>Flavor previously dated American model Beverly Johnson in 2000 and shared a tiny Bronx apartment with her and two children from a prior relationship. The flat was in a nasty part of town near Yankee Stadium.</p><h2>The Shocking Incident At Flavor Flav’s 2017 Show</h2><p>Aside from his marriage, Flavor Flav headlined Flavor Flav’s Vegas, a Las Vegas-based variety show, in December 2017.</p><p>In a November 2017 interview, he stated that he would interview celebrities, jam with musical guests, and do comic routines.</p><p>“I’ve always wanted to host a variety show, and I believe it’s about time. In addition, Las Vegas is in desperate need of a talk program. I want to be the one to bring the first real live talk show to Vegas. It won’t just be me interviewing guests; I’ll have a range of folks from the film, television, and music industries come via my show.”</p><p>Leon Knowles directed the show, and Teddy Riley, a Grammy winner, joined the crew as the series’ music director. In addition, he has joined the team of Master of the Sun – The Zombie Chronicles, a Marvel Comics graphic novel.</p><p>Ugandi Howard, a member of Public Enemy, attacked him at the South Point Casino in Las Vegas on January 23, 2018.</p><p>The flavor was accused of disrespecting Uganda’s mother, prompting Ugandi to attack the rapper. The entire altercation was captured on tape by the casino surveillance camera, in which Howard punched Flavor and then began punching him while he was on the ground.</p><h2>Flavor’s Reunion With His Ex-Girlfriend</h2><p>Flavour had a lot of women in his colorful dating life. After you’re in a relationship, you share a lot with your partner, but when you break up, all of your past memories turn bitter. Even just thinking about one’s ex might give one a nightmare; imagine meeting one’s ex. That can be a real pain in the neck.</p><p>When Flavour ran into his ex-girlfriend, he felt the same way. Tiffany “New York” Pollard is the ex-girlfriend in question. During the VH1 reality dating show Flavor of Love, she had a fling with Flavour. However, he destroyed Tiffany’s heart by choosing Nicole “Hoopz” Alexander over Tiffany.</p><p>The exes reconnected in 2018 for an episode of Braxton Family Values, six years after the devastating occasion.</p><p>The two didn’t quarrel since they had moved on from each other. Instead, Flavour and his ex had a private talk over a glass of whisky. It was a kind act on both of their parts, as they avoided allowing their past to taint the present and instead shared a friendly catch-up.</p><h2>Quick Information About Flavor Flav</h2><ul class=fact-information><li><strong>Date of Birth=</strong>1959-03-16</li><li><strong>Age=</strong>62 Years 2 Month(s)</li><li><strong>Nationality=</strong>American</li><li><strong>Birth Place=</strong>Roosevelt, Long Island, New York</li><li><strong>Profession=</strong>Rapper</li><li><strong>Birth Name=</strong>William Jonathan Drayton Jr.</li><li><strong>Nick Name=</strong>Flavor Flav</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign=</strong>Pisces</li><li><strong>Ethnicity/Race=</strong>Afro-American</li><li><strong>Father=</strong>William Sr.</li><li><strong>Mother=</strong>Anna Drayton</li><li><strong>Brother/s=</strong>Steven Drayton</li><li><strong>Sister/s=</strong>Jean Delores Madison</li><li><strong>Son/s=</strong>Karma Drayton, Shaniq Drayton, William Drayton</li><li><strong>Daughter/s=</strong>Dazyna Drayton, Quanah Drayton, Kayla Drayton, Jasmine Drayton</li><li><strong>Relationship Status=</strong>Married</li><li><strong>Wife/Spouse=</strong>Liz Trujillo</li><li><strong>Divorce/Split=</strong>Yes (Twice)</li><li><strong>Ex-Girlfriend=</strong>Brigitte Nielsen (2005)</li><li><strong>Ex-Wife=</strong>Karen Ross, Angie Parker</li><li><strong>Gay=</strong>No</li><li><strong>Net Worth=$3 Million</strong></li><li><strong>Career=</strong>1982–Present</li><li><strong>College=</strong>Adelphi University</li><li><strong>Height/ How Tall?=</strong>5 Feet 7 Inches (1.7 m)</li><li><strong>Weight=</strong>67 Kg (149 lbs)</li></ul>You may like;&nbsp;<a href=#>Ben Whishaw</a> &nbsp;Thank you very much.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaJ6clsOwvoyfo5quXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
