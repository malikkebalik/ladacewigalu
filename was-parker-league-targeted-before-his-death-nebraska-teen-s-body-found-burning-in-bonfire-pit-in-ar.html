League was reported missing by his father on June 15 while he was visiting Tempe, Arizona, with his belongings found at a residence shortly after. However, his body had been found three days earlier, on June 12, smoldering in a makeshift bonfire pit near Lost Dutchman State Park.</p><h2 class=split>Maricopa County Sheriff's Office Investigates Homicide</h2><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><p>The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office has classified League's death as a "malicious" act and is treating it as a homicide.

League had flown out of Nebraska on June 9 and was scheduled to return on June 12, the same day his body was found. His family filed a missing persons report three days later, unaware of the tragic discovery at that time. Hunter League, Parker's brother, recalled their last communication on June 10, stating that he knew his brother had arrived at his destination but had minimal contact afterward. Hunter speculated that Parker might have been targeted due to possessing an expensive watch during the trip.</p><h2 class=split>Was Parker League targeted before his death?</h2><p>“The information we have available for release is he was found in the pile burning,” sheriff’s spokesman Sgt Joaquin Enriquez told . “So as far as the other details of whether he was placed there, whether that’s where he was, those are details we can’t get into. Only certain people know details of that crime, so they can’t be released to protect the integrity of the investigation.” Family members also noted two suspicious transactions in Parker's bank account, suggesting unauthorized use of his debit card for food purchases and an attempt to pay an electric bill. These findings further deepened the mystery surrounding his death.&nbsp;</p><p>In response to the tragic incident, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Department has heightened patrols in the ravine where the crime occurred. Enriquez acknowledged the unique challenges posed by the remote area, including homelessness and limited accessibility to 4x4 vehicles. Law enforcement aims to explore all possible leads and physical evidence, recognizing the complexity of the investigation given the location and potential environmental factors.</p><h2 class=split>Investigative Challenges</h2><p>“He was visiting a friend. The investigation continues to determine whether this was a family friend. Was this a close friend? Was this somebody he met? We don’t know,” Enriquez told KPNX. “But we work every avenue, every angle, especially with a crime like this, in such a remote area,” Enriquez said. “We also rely on physical evidence. And you’re talking about the elements of where this was found a whole day after, maybe. So we deal with a lot of different elements that we have to go through. But to say that we know who did this would be premature.”</p><p>Hunter, who is two years older than Parker and considered him his best friend, struggled to come to terms with the loss, describing his brother as "the nicest kid in the world." He explained to how the tragic news had hit the family hard. “I got a call from my dad telling me to come home,” Hunter emotionally recalled. “I asked him ‘why’ about three times, and the third time he tried to explain it, he just started breaking down.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5GoerGt0aScq2Wcmq6owcRmq5qql5rBprCMm5yfp6Kaeqm10mabnpmknXqvscGrmKyjkWLBprHNrGSbp5Sueqe71KebZpqlp7uqusZmoKdlkqS7p7XRnmSpoaRitq95wKugs6eelg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
