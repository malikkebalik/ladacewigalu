LA Lakers general manager <strong>Rob Pelinka</strong> revealed at <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kobe’s memorial</a> that the NBA great had texted him from the helicopter the morning of the fatal crash asking for a favor — could he help 16-year-old <strong>Alexis Altobelli</strong> get an internship in the baseball world? He wanted Rob, a former sports agent himself, to ask famed baseball agent Scott Boras to take Alexis under his wing; he would serve as a character reference for the talented teen.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Alexis lost her parents, Orange Coast College baseball coach <strong>John Altobelli</strong> and <strong>Keri Altobelli</strong>, and her sister, <strong>Alyssa Altobelli</strong>, in the January 25 <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>helicopter accident</a> that killed Kobe and <strong>Gianna Bryant</strong>, as well as four others.

Alexis’ father coached baseball at the college, located in Costa Mesa, California, for 27 years. Her older brother, <strong>J.J. Altobelli</strong>, is a scout for the Boston Red Sox. The late Altobellis were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>honored with a memorial</a> of their own at Angels Stadium in Anaheim, California, where J.J. gave a passionate eulogy. “The amount of love and support we have received these last few weeks has been truly amazing. Each text, call, donation, or act of kindness has not gone unnoticed,” he said, fighting through tears. “The legacy they left will continue to live on through all of us. But, for tonight, let’s all live by my dad’s favorite motto: you drinkin’ or thinkin’?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH1ze5FvZpqkla22tHnApauompWhuap5wZqqnpqRoblutc2tnKumo522sXnKqJmeZZKnxqK602ajmqukYsSqv8dmq56wpGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
