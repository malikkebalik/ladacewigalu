ZZ Top Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴  Line by Line Meaning ↴She's really upset with me again
I didn't give her what she likes
I don't know what to tell her
Don't know what to say
Everything got funky last nightShe was really bombed
And I was really blown away Until I asked her what she wanted
And this is what she had to say:
A pearl necklace"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The singer explains that he doesn't know what to say to her because everything got funky the night before. The woman was really drunk, and the singer was blown away until he asked her what she wanted, and she said she wants a pearl necklace. The woman gets a charge out of being weird and getting downright strange. The singer can handle anything she throws at him without becoming deranged. The singer emphasizes that the pearl necklace the woman wants isn't actually jewelry and doesn't cost that much.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>She's really upset with me again</u><br>My significant other is angry with me once more.</p><br><p><u>I didn't give her what she likes</u><br>I failed to satisfy her sexual desires.</p><br><p><u>I don't know what to tell her</u><br>I am unsure how to respond to her anger and disappointment.</p><br><p><u>Don't know what to say</u><br>I am at a loss for words to communicate how I feel or what I want.</p><br><p><u>Everything got funky last night</u><br>Things became confusing, awkward, and possibly sexually charged last night.</p><br><p><u>She was really bombed</u><br>She was drunk and possibly impaired in her judgments.</p><br><p><u>And I was really blown away</u><br>I was also intoxicated and unable to think clearly.</p><br><p><u>Until I asked her what she wanted</u><br>I inquired about her sexual desires.</p><br><p><u>And this is what she had to say:</u><br>She disclosed her sexual preference to me.</p><br><p><u>A pearl necklace</u><br>She desires a strand of pearl jewelry around her neck.</p><br><p><u>She gets a charge out of bein' so weird</u><br>She feels a sense of excitement in engaging in taboo or unconventional sexual behavior.</p><br><p><u>Digs gettin' downright strange</u><br>She enjoys engaging in explicit and unconventional sexual acts.</p><br><p><u>But I can keep a handle on anything</u><br>I have the ability to manage any sexual behavior or kink.</p><br><p><u>Just this side of deranged</u><br>My sexual desires are slightly unconventional or taboo.</p><br><p><u>And she held it in her hand</u><br>She held a pearl necklace in her hand.</p><br><p><u>She's so tough, as pure as the driven slush</u><br>She is strong and resilient, but her sexual desires are unconventional.</p><br><p><u>And that's not jewelry she's talkin' about</u><br>She is not referring to actual jewelry, but rather an explicit sexual act.</p><br><p><u>It really don't cost that much</u><br>This sexual act isn't expensive or hard to obtain.</p><br><p><u>And she took it in her hand</u><br>She held the pearl necklace in her hand again.</p><br><p><u>She want a pearl necklace</u><br>She desires to engage in a specific sexual act.</p><br><p><u>She want a pearl necklace</u><br>She desires to engage in a specific sexual act.</p><br><p><u>She want a pearl necklace</u><br>She desires to engage in a specific sexual act.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © BMG Rights Management, Universal Music Publishing Group<br>Written by: FRANK BEARD, BILLY GIBBONS, DUSTY HILL</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maJKKlKGwvI6JnJqqnJSbpq%2FKpZicnQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
