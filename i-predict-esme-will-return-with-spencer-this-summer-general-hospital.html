Either bring back esme as esme and let her redemption begin or bring her back as a new character but no more using esme as a punching bag to forgive other characters .</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>She’s an excellent actress but she has gone off to college full-time, that’s why she left. I wish she hadn’t had a part where she’s so hateful and unredeemable. But I stand by what I believe, she had every right to go berserk at the end towards Spencer, he took her baby and gave him to Nicholas, so not rehashing but she was in the right. I hate Spencer’s character and I’m sorry he’s coming back.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/d/97f17d/48.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Dkingz1130:<p>They’ve done this before with characters leaving and coming back I expect the same with Eame!</p><p>I so totally agree with this opinion! I believe we will first see Spencer and Esme together having washed ashore and living somewhere in Europe.

I heard she was finishing up her Master’s degree which is why she left the show. Maybe this means she already found a job in doing what she went to school for then. I would be totally okay with the actress who was substituting for Eden while she was out on leave, the actress who played the temporary Joss I think she’d be real good as well.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvIZqernZSesLV5xKyknmWnnrmtedGeq66qnmLEqsDHZqqpnZ6YsrN506GgrGWjqrqusdFob2tqaWp9</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
