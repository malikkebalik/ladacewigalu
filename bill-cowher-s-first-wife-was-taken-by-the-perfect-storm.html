Cancer got into her bloodstream and settled into her lungs.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>After his spouse's death, he became an advocate for melanoma screening.</p><h2>Is Bill Cowher Married Now?</h2><p>Even though Bill has never talked about the pain Kaye went through in her final months, he was fine and happy soon after.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He had started learning the piano and played tennis during his retirement. Further, during his talk with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sports Illustrated</a> in December 2011, he revealed he spent more time with his daughters. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Bill Cowher with his second wife Veronica and extended family.</strong> (Photo: Bill Cowher/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Bill got an apartment in New York soon after.
