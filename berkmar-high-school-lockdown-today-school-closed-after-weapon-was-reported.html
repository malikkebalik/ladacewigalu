She was just getting to campus as the school locked down. She says lockdown started because of a fight and a student said they had a gun. Lilburn police say the students involved have been identified and are being questioned. There is now a lockdown at Berkmar High School. Today, law enforcement is looking into the situation.</p><p>The mental and emotional cost of a lockdown should not be minimized in any way. During times like these, many people, particularly students, can feel increased levels of anxiety and panic. Students at Berkmar High School were significantly aided by the school’s counselors and support personnel in achieving the goals of feeling safe and understood. The immediate implementation of specialized programs to meet any psychological or emotional needs that occurred as a result of the lockdown was a priority.</p><p>This all-encompassing strategy demonstrated the school’s dedication not only to the students’ physical safety but also to their emotional and mental well-being. A circumstance that nobody could have foreseen recently confronted Berkmar High School, which is known for being a center of study and development for its student body. As a precautionary measure in reaction to a potential danger, the institution went into lockdown mode, which resulted in an eerie stillness throughout the campus rather than the usual hustling and bustling activity. To protect the pupils, the teachers closed their classroom doors, turned down the lights, and herded them into safe areas of the school. The lessons that were acquired during the recent lockdown at Berkmar High School will likely impact the school’s future strategy towards safety and readiness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtp5Kewbat0bJlnKedZK%2BmvsqmmKtlmJ60qXnSnJ%2Bop5xiubCvyp2msKZdqbylrdhmqpygn6S5bq%2FLqKqenF2Ws7Wx0WaunpmgpLtuw8CsZKudoKS%2FtbHDaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
