A series of Christmas displays are also planned in locations across the US, including Texas, Florida, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Louisiana.</p><p>More details can be found at <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://skyelementsdrones.com/</a></p><p>The upcoming events will feature a combination of scenes, 3D animations, and lifelike motions, and have been developed with a focus on the festive season, with popular images such as Christmas trees and snowmen being designed with a unique new aesthetic. Each show will also be documented, and the firm plans to share behind-the-scenes photos and videos on social media channels.</p><p>Sky Elements Drone Shows states that it uses some of the brightest LED lighting systems in the industry, and expects attendees to see previously unachievable levels of clarity at the new Christmas and New Year’s events. The firm points out that this technology also allows shows to be viewed from a greater distance, which increases safety and the number of people who can attend.</p><p>While adverse weather conditions are not unusual in December, Sky Elements Drone Shows also explains that its drones are designed to operate in some cross winds, which reduces the likelihood that a show will be delayed or cancelled.</p><p>“Hot off the heels of our record-breaking displays at IAAPA 2023, our award-winning show designers have developed a new Christmas event that promises to wow audiences across the US,” a company representative explained. “Our drones have the brightest LED lights of any light show drone in service. Bright lights mean the show can be viewed from greater distances, increases safety during the show, and allows greater range of creativity.”</p><p>About Sky Elements Drone Shows</p><p>Headquartered in North Richland Hills, Texas, Sky Elements Drone Shows is now one of the leading drone show innovators in the US. The firm’s November events at IAAPA 2023 broke two Guinness World Records for the largest flag and the largest logo, each containing a formation of 1,592 drones.</p><p>“It’s amazing how the team can use drone technology to create such complex shapes and animations,” one client recently stated. “The shows are simply incredible, and I definitely recommend Sky Elements for any holiday or special event you’re planning.”</p><p>Interested parties can find more information by visiting <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://skyelementsdrones.com/</a></p><p>Contact Info:<br>Name: Rick Boss<br>Email: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Send Email</a><br>Organization: Sky Elements Drone Shows<br>Address: 3819 Rufe Snow Dr #203, North Richland Hills, TX 76180, United States<br>Website: <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://skyelementsdrones.com/</a><br></p><p>Source: NewsNetwork</p><p>Release ID: 89117544</p><p>In the event of any inaccuracies, problems, or queries arising from the content shared in this press release, we encourage you to notify us immediately at error@releasecontact.com.
