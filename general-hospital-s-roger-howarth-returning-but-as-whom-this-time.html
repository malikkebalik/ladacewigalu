Not forever, mind you. Howarth is sure to score a new soap role in less time than it will take you to read this article.</p><h2>Ready, Willing and Able</h2><p>“I’m an actor. I love acting,” the soap vet said when asked by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Soap Opera Digest</a> whether he was open to doing another daytime drama. He’s “100 percent” into the idea. “If somebody’s gonna ask me, I’m gonna go! I’m gonna get in the car.”</p><p>The question is, which show will snap up the fan favorite first? Since he’s never appeared on The Young and the Restless, The Bold and the Beautiful or Days of Our Lives, he couldn’t reprise a role on any of those serials. But he could certainly rock a recast, as he did on both As the World Turns and General Hospital.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/JPI_Episode13612_0001593301.jpeg alt='Kin Shriner, Roger Howarth"General Hospital" SetThe Prospect StudiosABC Studios06/29/16© XJJOHNSON/jpistudios.com310-657-9661Episode # 13612U.S. Airdate 08/3/16' width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Go Bold or Go Home</h2><p>The Bold and the Beautiful could tap the actor to play Blake Hayes, the unstable ex-husband of Taylor (for whom Steffy’s son is bizarrely named). Peter Brown, who originated the role, passed away in 2016. But there’s still a lot of story to be told with the character, especially if he came back to Los Angeles proclaiming to be a changed man. If Taylor bought it, would her waffling former spouse Ridge get all territorial and protective…&nbsp;in such a way that it made trouble in paradise with his favorite missus, Brooke?</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/JPI_Episode8790_0001975851-e1663791948671.jpg alt="Thorsten Kaye, Krista Allen taylor ridge jpi bb" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>On The Young and the Restless, Howarth could give the Newmans and the Abbotts a run for their (vast quantities of money) by reintroducing the Prentiss family — starting with Brooks, aka the son of Bold & Beautiful star John McCook’s Lance Prentiss and Leslie Brooks. The character hasn’t been on the show since he was a kid, so he could’ve grown up to be a real mover and shaker like his dad. And Brooks would be a great romantic interest for Phyllis; we already know that Howarth and Michelle Stafford have chemistry galore thanks to their General Hospital pairing as Franco and Nina.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Franco-Nina-Happy-GH-HW.jpg alt width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Something New, Something Old</h2><p>At Days of Our Lives, Howarth could — and, we’d argue, should — play an altogether new character. Let the actor, who’s so great at fleshing out his parts, invent someone from scratch, drop him in Salem and turn him loose on the dating scene. Allow the character to have some fun with the fact that everyone in town just goes around breaking up and making up with their exes in a never-ending cycle. Have him swear off the Nicoles and Sarahs of Salem to try his luck on a matchmaking app and wind up being paired with, of all people, Kristen!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/170079_0847.jpg alt='GENERAL HOSPITAL - Episode “15303” - "General Hospital" airs Monday - Friday, on ABC (check local listings).

Now that, sadly, the streaming version of One Life to Live is defunct, he could always bring Todd Manning back to Port Charles. Not only did his Llanview counterpart throw eye-popping sparks with Carly, his on-again/off-again soulmate Blair Cramer now has ties to Port Charles, owing to ex-husband Martin Grey.</p><p><strong>Catch up on <a href=# rel=noopener>all the latest — and next —&nbsp;General Hospital exits</a> in the below photo gallery.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmoJ2emr%2BiuIyhpqyomamurXvNnq6sZ2ZuhnV%2Bk2ipqJ%2BVp3qpu9aaqa2gXaeytcHRp6Cnn18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
