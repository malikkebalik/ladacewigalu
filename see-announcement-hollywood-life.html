So I was like ‘ok what’s going on?’ So eventually she came to Atlanta, and I think she like kissed me or something, and she was very like attentive and I had never had so much attention paid to me or felt so much affection from anybody,” she explained at the time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye5JqZp2ZXZe%2FosCMo5ysq5WYrm6w1KmYq6xdl66jxYyfoKurpGKwqbXLnWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
