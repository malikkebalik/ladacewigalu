Before hitting up his party at the swanky nightclub, Chris attended the <strong>Floyd Mayweather Jr.</strong>–<strong>Robert Guerrero</strong> boxing match at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. The fight was a huge spectacle and the king of the welterweights, Floyd Mayweather, ended up winning in an unanimous decision after 12 rounds of fighting.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Chris and his crew then got their party on at the club. The star sipped champagne and danced all night long, ringing in his May 5 birthday the right way.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>He actually might have overdone it: early in the morning on May 5 Chris tweeted, “Do too wasted at the party. Threw up crazy!! Lol!” Well, if there’s one day when you’re allowed to puke, it’s your birthday, right?</p><h3>Chris Brown: Missing Rihanna On His Birthday?</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>Chris has had an awesome birthday weekend, he’s just missing one thing —&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Rihanna</strong></a>. The&nbsp;Unapologetic&nbsp;singer has been marooned in the New York City area because of scheduled concerts on her “Diamonds” tour.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>HollywoodLife.com</a>&nbsp;</strong>reported EXCLUSIVELY that Chris “wished she could be with him on his birthday, just like he was with her,” according to a source. Rihanna surely would have treated Breezy like a king if she was able to celebrate with him. But the source assures us that the couple will still celebrate together when their schedules open up: “They’ll make it up to each other and it will go down,” the insider says.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>What do you think,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?
