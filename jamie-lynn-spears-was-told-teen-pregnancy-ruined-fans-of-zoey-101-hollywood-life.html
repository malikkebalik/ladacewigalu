I didn’t want to let anybody down, but I had to do what was right for me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The now 32-year-old actress announced she was expecting her first child with then-boyfriend <strong>Casey Aldridge</strong> in December 2007 when she was just 16. Her announcement came just before Zoey 101’s fourth and final season premiered on Nickelodeon. The show had already been canceled and filmed prior to Jamie Lynn revealing her pregnancy.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Following Jamie Lynn’s teen pregnancy reveal, she received intense public backlash for her decision. “[People were] having the conversation of young girls my age were having sex. And I think people didn’t want that … Of like, this is going on, but a lot of them aren’t getting pregnant” she said. “If I would’ve had an abortion, no one would have known about it, but it wouldn’t have changed the fact that I had sex.&nbsp;So I think that was really the bigger conversation, like, ‘Now, young girls are going to want to have sex, or they are.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jamie-lynn-spears-teen-pregnancy-zoey-101-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Her daughter</a>, <strong>Maddie</strong>, is now 15 years old and has a brief cameo in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Zoey 102</a>, the Zoey 101 sequel movie that premiered on July 27.
