On April 29, KOZ Entertainment announced that Zico had been discharged from the military and had completed his service as a social worker in the Korean Army. Fans of the rapper though are joking about Zico coming back from the military and suddenly realizing he is part of the label HYBE after KOZ Entertainment merged with HYBE.</p><p>Back in 2011, <a href=# rel>Zico</a> made his debut with KQ Entertainment boy group Block B but after seven years with the label, Block B’s leader and rapper Zico parted ways from the label after the boy group’s last comeback in 2018. Soon after his departure from the label fans were worried about Zico’s future with the boy group. But, the rapper reassured fans that despite his solo ventures and participation in other crews, <a href=# rel>Zico</a> was still very much a part of Block B. The rapper then went on to launch his own label as he became the CEO and the first artist of KOZ Entertainment.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Is P.O still part of Block B?

Immediately after that as well as the update from KOZ Entertainment, fans began welcoming Zico with the hashtag #Welcome_Back_Zico. Zico completed his military service as a social worker.</p><p>KOZ Entertainment also revealed that Zico wanted to finish his military service without a separate event for fans in order to prevent the spread of Covid-19; which is why instead of hosting a fan gathering, the rapper greeted fans over social media. On the same day, Zico posted a photo of himself in his studio as he said, “Good to see you friends” in Korean. With him being in the studio so soon after his discharge, fans are anticipating a new hit as they joke about Zico becoming a part of HYBE labels.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/1edc5ac5-8c20-4cbd-bee7-9c3ceb81328c.jpg><h2 class=split>‘Mentally preparing myself for Zico’s bops'</h2><p>Because his label KOZ Entertainment was acquired by HYBE Labels after his enlistment, fans are joking about this as one said, “Zico coming back from the military to find out he’s in hybe NSKDNLSDJDK.” Another fan said, “Zico walking into the HYBE building like.” One fan greeted him saying, “Congratulations Zico.&nbsp; I hope he has a successful comeback- since his label was acquired by Hybe his successes can only benefit the Boys.” One more fan said, “KING IS BACK FR FR.”</p><p>Another fan said, “You served well, Woo Jiho!
