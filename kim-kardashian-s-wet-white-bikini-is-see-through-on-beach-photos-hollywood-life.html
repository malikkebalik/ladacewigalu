In the first photo, Kim sat on the ocean floor while wearing a white spaghetti-strap bikini top with a scoop neckline that revealed ample cleavage. The bottom half of the top was soaking wet, making it see-through. She looked off into the distance while her long platinum blonde hair was down in beach waves.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>In the second photo, Kim was kneeling on her knees while wearing the completely see-through two-piece. She was wiping the hair out of her face as she looked up to the sky with her eyes closed. Her incredibly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>toned abs</a> and tiny waist were on display, as were her bare nipples which could be seen through the sheer fabric of the top. She styled the top with matching, high-rise bottoms, which were also see-through. In the last photo, Kim looked into the camera with no makeup on as her hair was down and parted in the middle.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Just a day before, Kim posted a photo of her on the beach with her kids while the sun was setting. In the photo, her face couldn’t be seen but <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her toned figure</a> was on display. She rocked a strapless black bikini top with a pair of matching, low-rise bottoms.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>If there’s one thing for sure about Kim, it is that she loves a good bikini, and aside from these swimsuits on her trip, she recently posted photos of herself wearing a black Skims bikini from her brand’s holiday shop. In the photos, Kim wore an extremely <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tiny black triangle top</a> with black rhinestones on it that barely covered up her chest and she styled it with matching, super skinny, low-rise bottoms that had thin straps on the side that rested high up on her waist.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze5BsZqShnWK4or7DmqqhoZGjerix02auoaGkmnqjtcqipaJlo5qybsDHq6aun5hir6atwqFkqaCfqby0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
