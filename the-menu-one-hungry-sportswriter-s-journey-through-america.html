When the bosses at The Athletic decided to celebrate food and drink this summer, I volunteered. This finally would make me write down the list and catalogue everything that made each place special.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p dir=ltr>The original idea was that we’d provide you with a guide to help you find your next great meal as you traveled the country. Then the COVID-19 pandemic happened, and we all stopped traveling. Worse, the shutdown associated with the virus has decimated the restaurant industry. Dedicated chefs and servers have lost their jobs. Owners have seen their savings shrink toward zero. Restaurants have shuttered — some temporarily, some permanently. Across the country, the people who feed us are fighting for economic survival. This list is 300 restaurants long. It would have been closer to 400 a few months ago.</p><p dir=ltr>So perhaps we need to look at this list differently for now. Perhaps we need to find the places near us and make sure we grab a takeout meal every once in a while to help our neighbors get through what we hope is only a temporary downturn. Then, when we do get moving again, all these places will still be open so new visitors can discover them for themselves.</p><p dir=ltr>My plan for this state-by-state list and the accompanying interactive map is to make it a living document. Every time I eat a great meal at a place I’ve never been before, I’ll add it to the list. (So feel free to let me know where I need to try next.) I’ve personally eaten at all the places listed. If there are gaps — my sincere apologies, Philadelphia, Boston, Memphis and San Francisco — blame my bosses through the years for not sending me to those places enough. Trust me, I intend to fill those gaps. So if you see some seriously in-depth Temple and Cal coverage from me in the next year, you’ll know exactly why.</p><p dir=ltr>On to The List …</p><h2><strong>Alabama</strong></h2><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Acre</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> <span>Farm to Table</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 210 East Glenn Avenue, </span><span>Auburn, Ala.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Start with orders of pimento cheese and chicken-fried bacon. For the main course, go for the red snapper. And ask if they’ll ever make the softshell crab-in-Nashville-hot-chicken-style as an appetizer again.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Alabama Biscuit Company</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Breakfast</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 4133 White Oak Drive, </span><span>Birmingham, Ala.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> A bacon, egg and cheese biscuit (with Conecuh bacon). Also order a couple of extra biscuits with sorghum, because you can’t have enough biscuits.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Avondale Brewing Company</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Bar</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 201 41st Street South, </span><span>Birmingham, Ala.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Vanillaphant Porter Ale. And maybe some Spring Street Saison. And if you get hungry, you can walk to Saw’s Soul Kitchen, Post Office Pies or MELT.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Archibald’s</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Barbecue</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 1211 Martin Luther King Boulevard, </span><span>Northport, Ala.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> A slab of the best ribs in America. Don’t be fooled by the billboards advertising the more famous place in Tuscaloosa. The locals have been trying to keep this place their secret for years. But those ribs are just too perfect.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Avenue Pub</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Burgers</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 405 23rd Avenue, </span><span>Tuscaloosa, Ala.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> A bacon burger. There are no gimmicky ingredients — only a perfect bacon cheeseburger served alongside hand-cut fries. If you’re thirsty, add a Loretta Lemonade (Maker’s Mark, orange liqueur, fresh lemon juice).</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Big Bob Gibson Bar-B-Q</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Barbecue</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 1715 6th Avenue Southeast, </span><span>Decatur, Ala.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Pork, chicken or ribs. But add some turkey to whatever you choose. It’s tough to find great smoked turkey, but if you’re here, you’ve found it.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Blue Pacific at Hoover Food Mart</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Thai</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 3219 Lorna Road, </span><span>Birmingham, Ala.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> You might assume a 20-ounce Coke and some beef jerky because this space clearly used to be a gas station. But order some wings to start and then choose between Pad Thai and Pad Kee Mao. Whichever one you pick, make it a beef, chicken and shrimp combo.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bottega Cafe</a></strong></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Italian</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 2240 Highland Avenue, </span><span>Birmingham, Ala.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The menu has shrunk during the quarantine, but you can still pick up lobster and shrimp bucatini or a fried oyster sandwich to go.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bow And Arrow</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Barbecue</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 1977 East Samford Avenue, </span><span>Auburn</span><span>, Ala.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> They’re currently transitioning into a full-service concept, but when they reopen, they’ll still be serving moist brisket and juicy ribs. Hopefully they’ll still offer brisket tacos, which are common in Texas but remain a delicacy east of the Mississippi River.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Butcher Paper BBQ</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Barbecue</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 128 Columbus Parkway, </span><span>Opelika, Ala.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> A “regular” pulled pork sandwich will run you $5.55, but that thing is a monster. Add some Brunswick stew and smoked mac and cheese and you might still be too full to eat dinner hours later.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Chuck’s Fish</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Seafood</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 508 Greensboro Avenue, </span><span>Tuscaloosa, Ala.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Whatever fish is fresh that day, grilled over hickory with crawfish cream. Then order a pineapple jalapeño margarita and hang at the bar while soaking up the scene.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Delta Blues Hot Tamales</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Southern-Mex</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 3569 Pelham Parkway, </span><span>Pelham, Ala.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The plan is for this tamale spot, which started in Birmingham, to reopen in Pelham in July 2020. When it does, get the Crawdaddy (tamales smothered with housemade crawfish étouffée) and some Delta catfish tacos.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Dumbwaiter</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> American</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 167 Dauphin Street, </span><span>Mobile, Ala.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The New South Brussels Sprouts — with giant chunks of bacon among the sprouts — is a great start. After that, order the shrimp and grits or the grilled rack of lamb.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Felix’s Fish Camp</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Seafood</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 1530 Battleship Parkway, </span><span>Spanish Fort, Ala.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The turtle soup with sherry to start. Then it’s barbecue shrimp or grilled fish as you watch the sun set over Mobile Bay.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Guido’s</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Italian/Seafood</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 1709 Main Street, </span><span>Daphne, Ala.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Something that came out of the (very) nearby Gulf of Mexico. If the chalkboard menu includes triggerfish or amberjack, order immediately. But don’t forget the Crawfish Penne.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Hound</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Gastropub</p><p><strong>Address: </strong><span>124 Tichenor Avenue,&nbsp;</span><span>Auburn</span><span>, Ala.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Mama Sue’s pepper jelly to start. After you’ve dunked crackers in pepper jelly and cream cheese, order a Big Fat Ribeye and wash it down with a Tin Cup (Tincup whiskey, fresh lime juice, ginger-cilantro simple syrup, Fentiman’s ginger beer, chile and lime bitters).</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>K&J Rib Shack</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Barbecue</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 1041 Perry Hill Road, </span><span>Montgomery, Ala.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Ribs. Get a half slab or a full slab. If they have turnip greens as a side, buy as much as you can. Otherwise, enjoy your ribs and black-eyed peas.</span></p><h3 id=m_6521623647782605114docs-internal-guid-3a8089bb-7fff-91e2-815a-6b6813bfe4b9 dir=ltr><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Meat Boss</strong></a></h3><p dir=ltr><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Barbecue</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Address:</strong> 5401 Cottage Hill Road, Mobile, Ala.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> One of the planet’s best pulled pork sandwiches on a sweet bun. The juicy, bark-covered pork requires no enhancement whatsoever. Still, you’ll be tempted to add something. In addition to the usual selection of sauces, Meat Boss essentially offers the topping list of a build-your-own-burger restaurant. I had never thought of putting jalapeño jelly on a pulled pork sandwich until I saw the jelly on the menu. I went for it, and I inhaled the first sandwich so quickly that I had to order a second. By all means get that sandwich, but if you’re still hungry, Meat Boss is on the very short list of barbecue joints that make excellent baby back ribs. Baby backs require careful cooking because of their lower fat content, and Meat Boss cooks them very carefully.</p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>MELT</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Sandwiches</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 4105 4th Avenue South, </span><span>Birmingham, Ala.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The 3 Amigos. That’s ham, sliced chorizo, an over-easy egg, monterey and habañero jack cheeses on Texas toast.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3 dir=ltr><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Post Office Pies</strong></a></h3><p dir=ltr><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Pizza</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Address:</strong> 209 41st Street South, Birmingham, Ala.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The Swine, which loads tomato sauce, sausage, slab Bacon, pepperoni, aged mozzarella and basil on a bubbly crust basked in a wood-fired oven.</p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Royal Scam</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> American</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 72 South Royal Street, </span><span>Mobile, Ala.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The Steak Sandwich Scam, with grilled beef tenderloin, sautéed mushrooms, sautéed onions, Havarti and spinach. And if you’re there in late January, you could see half of the front office personnel in the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>NFL</a> comparing notes on Senior Bowl prospects.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Salem’s Diner</a></strong></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> <span>Diner</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 2913 18th Street South, </span><span>Birmingham, Ala.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The trash can with a lid. That’s hashbrowns, onions, peppers, tomatoes, cheese and spicy sausage covered with two eggs. And ask Wayne to throw in some biscuits to sop up everything.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Saw’s Barbecue</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Barbecue</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 1008 Oxmoor Road, </span><span>Homewood, Ala.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The Saw’s Sampler: It’s chicken (with Alabama white sauce), ribs and pulled pork with two sides. Get greens and green beans.</span></p><h3 dir=ltr><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Saw’s Soul Kitchen</strong></a></h3><p dir=ltr><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Barbecue</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Address:</strong> 215 41st Street South, Birmingham, Ala.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The pork and greens — which is pulled pork and collard greens over some of the creamiest grits you’ve ever eaten. Get a side of smoked wings for everyone to share.</p><h3 dir=ltr><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Slice Stone Pizza and Brew</strong></a></h3><p dir=ltr><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Pizza</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Address:</strong> 725 29th Street South, Birmingham, Ala.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The Soul Pie sounds insane. It has turnip greens, black-eyed peas, Conecuh sausage, grilled red onions, bacon, pepper jack & cheddar cheese. Just eat it. It’s basically dinner at my grandmama’s house on a pizza.</p><h2><strong>Arizona</strong></h2><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Barrio Cafe</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Mexican</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 2814 North 16th Street No. 1205, </span><span>Phoenix, Ariz.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> A Sergio El Suave (añejo tequila, pineapple and lime juices, agave nectar, cilantro and candied jalapeño) to start. For your main course, get the Cochinita Pibil (pork slow roasted overnight wrapped in a banana leaf). Dessert is churros filled with goat’s milk caramel.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Beer Research Institute</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Bar</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 1641 S Stapley Drive, </span><span>Mesa, Ariz.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Beer, of course. The taps rotate constantly, but if they have it, try the Morning Sex (milk stout) or the Peach Lolli (a Belgian strong golden ale aged over peaches). Drink these with Meat Candy (sriracha bacon) and carne asada poutine.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Breakfast Club</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Breakfast</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 4400 North Scottsdale Road, </span><span>Scottsdale, Ariz.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The huevos con masa with chipotle cornbread and chorizo. Or maybe just some jalapeño biscuits and gravy. Or maybe cinnamon challah french toast. They’ll make sure the coffee keeps coming, too.</span></p><h3 dir=ltr><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Chompie’s</strong></a></h3><p dir=ltr><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Deli</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Address:</strong> 4550 East Cactus Road, Phoenix, Ariz.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>You’re ordering:</strong>&nbsp;The Original Jewish Sliders, which pack brisket, potato pancakes and jack cheese into mini Challah rolls. Then, to make them somehow more perfect, this Phoenix-area mini-chain includes a side of brown gravy for dipping. One order is a meal unto itself, but if you’re in a group, you can split an order of sliders and have a corned beef and pastrami on rye or a Monte Cristo for your entree.</p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Chuckbox</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Burgers</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 202 East University Drive, </span><span>Tempe, Ariz.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The Great Big One (the half-pound burger) with jalapeño jack and bacon.

That’s a bacon-wrapped hot dog stuffed into a pocket-shaped bun and loaded with onions and jalapeños and various condiments. Under normal circumstances at El Guero Canelo, you can choose which peppers you’d like from a stocked pepper and salsa bar. In the current takeout-only environment, you’ll need to know what you want when you order. Here’s a tip: Choose jalapeño sauce and have them add a few cucumbers and jalapeños. The cukes will keep you cool while the peppers heat you up.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Little Miss BBQ</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Barbecue</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 8901 North 7th Street, </span><span>Phoenix, Ariz.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The best barbecue west of the Rockies. Order brisket, pork ribs and (if it’s Friday or Saturday) beef short ribs.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pizzeria Bianco</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Pizza</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 623 East Adams Street, </span><span>Phoenix, Ariz.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The Sonny Boy, which features salami, olives and fresh mozzarella. If you find yourself at the Camelback Road location, also try the pappardelle bolognese.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tacos Chiwas</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Tacos</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 1923 East McDowell Road, </span><span>Phoenix, Ariz.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Al pastor, tongue and tripe tacos. Also, order the Taco Chiwas (beef, ham, jalapeño, Anaheim chiles, Asadero cheese) and the Desherbrada Verde (green shredded beef) gordita.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Taco Guild</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Tacos</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 546 East Osborn Road, </span><span>Phoenix, Ariz.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Carnitas, chicken tinga and molida lamb tacos in a converted church that was erected in 1893.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>U.S. Egg Breakfast and Lunch</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Breakfast</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 7119 East Shea Boulevard, </span><span>Scottsdale, Ariz.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> A meat lovers skillet with chicken-fried steak, bacon, sausage, ham & sausage gravy topped with two eggs over hash browns. Or get the Going South omelette with chorizo and green chiles. This mini-chain is stationed throughout the Valley Of The Sun, and it’s a great place to turn a one-hour breakfast meeting into a four-hour breakfast meeting.</span></p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Arkansas</strong></h2><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Catfish Hole</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Comfort food</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 4127 West Wedington Drive, </span><span>Fayetteville, Ark.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Catfish and the world’s best hush puppies. And maybe someone gets a steak, because they do those shockingly well. And for dessert, a fried chocolate pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Craig’s Bar-B-Q</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Barbecue</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 15 West Walnut Street, </span><span>DeValls Bluff, Ark.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Pork sandwiches. And pick up some bottles of sauce. Those who know me know I only consider barbecue sauce useful for covering mistakes. They don’t make mistakes at Craig’s, but we all make them at home. And Craig’s sauce — which tastes like a cross between tomato-based sauce and Pickapeppa — covers them beautifully.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Theo’s</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Gastropub</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 318 Campbell Avenue, </span><span>Fayetteville, Ark.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Theo’s closed in March and has yet to reopen. Hopefully it will, because it would be a shame if we couldn’t get that thick, juicy sous vide pork chop with bacon marmalade and bourbon sauce.</span></p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>California</strong></h2><h3><a href=#><strong>The Apple Pan</strong></a></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Diner</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 10801 West Pico Boulevard, </span><span>Los Angeles, Calif.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> A burger that hasn’t changed much since the 1940s. Get the Steakburger, add a patty and request melted Tillamook cheddar. It’ll come off the grill gooey and greasy, and you’ll have to move fast before all that liquid soaks through the paper wrapper and into the bun. But after that first bite, that burger won’t last long. Then you’ll be on to the apple pie a la mode.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Brodard Chateau</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Vietnamese</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 9100 Trask Avenue, </span><span>Garden Grove, Calif.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Ribeye rolls (steak, pickled veggies, cucumber and mint rolled in rice paper) to start. Then follow that with Bun Cha Ha Noi (pork in lime chile fish sauce).</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Coolhaus</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Ice cream</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 8588 Washington Boulevard, </span><span>Culver City, Calif.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> An ice cream sandwich with salted caramel ice cream bulging from between two snickerdoodle cookies. Or maybe two scoops of Aunt Gladys Yellow Cake Batter ice cream. The good news is CoolHaus also ships and is supplying stores with its creations.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Deli-Licious</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Sandwiches</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 16582 Gothard Street, </span><span>Huntington Beach, Calif.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Victor’s Meatball with an Attitude. It’s mini meatballs in a spicier-than-you-think sauce on a hoagie. Get a side of Deli’s Chunky Chili Mac (chorizo chili over mac and cheese) on the side. Bring a wheelbarrow to get rolled out.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jubba Somalian Restaurant</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Somalian</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 5330 Terner Way, </span><span>San Jose, Calif.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The Sports Plate. I’m not sure which sport the name references, but it might involve Joey Chestnut. This two-meat dish is supposed to feed two but could feed four. Get the beef suqaar and roasted goat cutlet and get a rice/spaghetti combo. Then order a side of chapati to sop everything up. While you’re there, go to the back and fill up your cup with a cinnamon-cardamom-and-they’re-keeping-the-rest-a-secret tea that will make everything a little brighter.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Kettle</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Diner</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 1138 Highland Avenue, </span><span>Manhattan Beach, Calif.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> If you’re there for breakfast or lunch, get the honey fried chicken and biscuits. If you’re there later, choose a grilled four-cheese dip and add bacon. They’re open all night.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kogi BBQ</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Korean/Tacos</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 3434 Overland Avenue, </span><span>Los Angeles, Calif.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Short rib tacos — as many as they’ll give you. They started serving at the Overland Avenue location on June 23, but you might find a truck closer to you. Check the website or Kogi BBQ’s social media feeds to learn where in Los Angeles and Orange counties the trucks are today. Then track down the nearest one. You’ll want to eat about 50 of those tacos.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Mexico Bakery</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Sandwiches</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 2811 Story Road, </span><span>San Jose, Calif.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The carne asada torta. And you probably won’t be able to leave without buying flan or some conchas (sweet bread rolls).</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Mission Street BBQ</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Barbecue</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 1618 Mission Street, </span><span>Santa Cruz, Calif.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Ribs, pulled pork or tri-tip. Then you can marvel at finding good barbecue so close to the Pacific.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pizza Port</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Pizza</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 135 North Highway 101, </span><span>Solana Beach, Calif.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> This San Diego-area institution — with multiple locations — is probably more famous for its beer than its pizza.

Specifically, you’re getting Herb’s Special, which comes with a breast, a thigh, a leg, a wing and two waffles. Other than peanut butter and jelly, there is no more perfect combo than fried chicken and waffles. That combo freaked everyone out when Roscoe’s opened in 1975, but now restaurants across the country have copied the formula. In a town that chases trends like no other, Roscoe’s has built an institution serving basics done right. And because people will always crave chicken and always crave waffles, there will always be a Roscoe’s.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Slater’s 50/50 Burger</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Burgers</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 6362 East Santa Ana Canyon Road, </span><span>Anaheim Hills, Calif.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> A burger made with 50 percent ground beef and 50 percent ground bacon.

What’s a half-smoke? It’s not a hot dog. It’s spicier, and the meat is ground differently. This particular cased meat is native to the DMV area, and Ben’s has been serving half-smokes topped with tangy chili, mustard and onions on steamed buns since 1958.

Yes, 4 Rivers has expanded from its original humble home down Fairbanks Avenue from this newish flagship and tried to take over the Sunshine State one city at a time, but chain barbecue is only bad if the barbecue actually tastes bad.

A trip to Bern’s is about the experience as much as it is the steak. With any luck, you can still get a (socially distant) tour of the wine cellar and kitchen. The latter location is home to one of the more precise culinary operations in America.

You go to Bern’s (also on this list) for the experience, but you go to Charley’s for the steak. And the good news is you can also get that same steak at Charley’s in Orlando.

That pie is quite spicy, so if you brought a friend, you might also order a Capricciosa (a white pie with mushrooms, artichokes, prosciutto and fresh mozzarella) to mellow out the vibe.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>B’s Cracklin BBQ</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Barbecue</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 725 Ponce De Leon Avenue NE, </span><span>Atlanta, Ga.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Ribs and some pulled pork to put between slices of cracklin’ cornbread. Pitmaster Bryan Furman opened the first B’s in Savannah, Ga., and expanded to Atlanta’s Riverside neighborhood in 2016. He was making some of the best barbecue in the country when his store burned down in March 2019. Undaunted, Furman reopened inside a Kroger supermarket near Ponce City Market, but he still plans to open a new standalone store back in Riverside. The good news is that even though the menu is pared down at the Kroger location, B’s is still serving hash and rice, the king of barbecue sides that you’ve probably never eaten unless you’re from South Carolina or Georgia.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Community Q BBQ</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Barbecue</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 1361 Clairmont Road, </span><span>Decatur, Ga.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Pulled pork, chicken and ribs.

Or pasta. This is the choice diners face when they enter Eats. And though these seem like two incongruous blocks upon which to build a restaurant, Eats has been satisfying diners for almost 30 years. When I interned at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1999, I ate there at least twice a week. Sometimes I had jerk chicken. Sometimes I had spaghetti. I always left happy.&nbsp; There was no decline in quality on subsequent visits in the years since, though I definitely gravitate more to the jerk chicken. Eats is closed at the moment because of the pandemic.

Other places have popped up and received more acclaim, but Fat Matt’s keeps pumping out tender, juicy ribs with a side of white bread and a blues soundtrack.

Fox Bros. was one of the first places in the non-Texas South to get brisket right, and the people of Atlanta seem eternally grateful. But don’t stop there. Fox Bros. also makes exquisite ribs.

Chef Jiyeon Lee was a pop star in her native Korea. (Yes, really.) But for nearly a decade, she’s been a barbecue star. That sandwich, which comes bursting with pork brushed with a spicy-sweet sauce, fuses two cooking styles beautifully. But Heirloom Market also makes scrumptious ribs that require no sauce. For a side, try the Korean sweet potatoes.

I’m not normally a brunch person, but that concept was invented for a place like Mama’s Boy because you’re going to eat more than two meals’ worth of food while you’re there. As soon as you see the football-sized cinnamon rolls, you’re going to order one. And you can’t leave without having the hash, which features pulled pork and two poached eggs over fried potatoes and sprinkled with vinegar barbecue sauce. That comes with a biscuit, but you probably still ordered biscuits and sausage-thyme gravy anyway.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Masterpiece</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Chinese</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 3940 Buford Highway B103, </span><span>Duluth, Ga.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Dong-po pork. It’s a block of pork belly braised in a dark rice wine sauce that adds spice and sweetness to a meat that already has savory covered. Let that sauce seep into a little rice, and then get a forkful of the pork, the sauce and the rice. Few bites can compare. But since this is a Sichuan restaurant, you shouldn’t leave without trying something that makes your tongue and lips tingle.

But these — in the Ponce City Market iteration of a place that started in Charleston, S.C. —&nbsp; are some of the best wings in the country. Charcoal-grilled wings come out smoky and juicy and then get tossed into a brown paper bag with Valentina hot sauce. They’re lighter than their deep-fried brethren, which should leave you room for tacos or a burrito. The achiote pork burrito with green salsa, cilantro, hoppin’ john and queso de Oaxaca should do the trick.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Oy!</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Breakfast</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 2355 Cumberland Parkway SE No. 80, </span><span>Atlanta, Ga.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Challah! Everyone’s favorite lumpy, bumpy egg bread is the star here. In the Scrumptious Challah Egg and Cheese Souffle, cheddar, Swiss and eggs get baked into challah, which is so sturdy that it neither burns nor gets broken down by the oils coming off the cheese and eggs. Instead, it provides the ideal foundation. Order the small, because then you also can order the small — read: not the size of your head — version of the challah French toast casserole. Once again, challah’s sturdiness shines through as it soaks up egg wash, syrup and caramel sauce. I typically shy away from French toast because of an aversion to drenched bread. But thanks to the challah, this French toast achieves the perfect level of moisture.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pulaski Heights BBQ</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Barbecue</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 675 Pulaski Street No. 100, </span><span>Athens, Ga</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Pulled pork and ribs if you’re just craving good barbecue.

The sandwich replaces mojo pork with pulled pork to go alongside the Swiss cheese, pickle and mustard.

Sure, the bacon thing is a gimmick. But as gimmicks go, bacon is tough to beat. The Bacon Board is a great start. It comes with Irish bacon, jowl bacon, cracked pepper bacon and Danish bacon. The fried bacon appetizer combined with the Bacon Board makes for a satisfying all-bacon meal. The truly foolish can try to eat the Bacon Bomb — a five-pound mix of meats wrapped in bacon — and fries in 45 minutes to win a T-shirt and a place on the wall.

Pequod’s doesn’t use the space between the top of the pie and the top of the crust as a deep sauce reservoir the way Geno’s East and Giordano’s do. The sauce goes under the cheese just like it does in most other parts of the country, but you still get that beautiful golden crust.

Meanwhile, the brisket can compete with the best places in Texas. That manifesto also includes this quote about people who drown meat in sauce, which tells you that Smoque is a quality barbecue joint: “They try to breathe new life into dry, tasteless meat by dousing it with an overpowering BBQ sauce — a shameful practice that we like to call artificial resaucitation. … Well, we won’t do it.

Back in 2011, I did a show on the Big Ten Network that required me to spend a day or two a week in Chicago. As the city’s beautiful summer turned to fall, I wasn’t quite prepared for how the wind would come whipping off Lake Michigan and race through the canyons created by all those skyscrapers. On a day when the gusts cut right through me, I took shelter from the cold in Soupbox. They make 12 fresh, from-scratch soups every day. There are staples like chicken noodle or vegetable and more exotic options like lobster bisque. But on that day, what I needed was the tomato soup with a grilled cheese on fresh-baked sourdough to dip in the bowl. It’s rare that the universe provides exactly what you need when you need it, but it did that day. And Soupbox got a lot of repeat business because of it.</span></p><h2><strong>Indiana</strong></h2><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Burger Study</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Burgers</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 28 West Georgia Street, Indianapolis, Ind.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Assuming this St. Elmo sister restaurant comes back from the pandemic (fingers crossed), get the Homecoming (a huge patty topped with gouda and thick-cut, root beer-glazed bacon.

That’s filé gumbo with chicken, shrimp, crab, sausage, crawfish, okra and tomato topped with fried catfish and oysters. It’s so filling, but it’s also so satisfying that you won’t stop until the bowl is dry. If you want to lighten things up on your next visit — which probably will come the next day or the next meal — then opt for the bronzed drum.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>City Pork</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Deli</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 2921 Government Street, </span><span>Baton Rouge, La.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Pork nachos (pulled pork with queso, coleslaw, jalapeño and barbecue sauce over house-made potato chips) to start.

The mint and cucumber provide a cool counterbalance to the heft of the pork belly. Of course, you’re going to wreck that balance with pancetta mac and cheese. But that’s OK. You’re probably coming back the next day for a different sandwich. Maybe the Buckboard Bacon Melt (bacon and cheese with collard greens on white bread) or Butcher’s version of a Muffaletta. They’re all great.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3><a href=#><strong>Cou-yon’s</strong></a></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Barbecue</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 470 North Alexander Avenue, </span><span>Port Allen, La.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Chicken and turkey, two high-degree-of-difficulty barbecue meats that Cou-Yon’s does incredibly well.

For dinner, get the crawfish hand pie (crawfish, corn and sausage fried in a handmade crust and served with cajun cream) or the seafood pot pie (crawfish, shrimp and crab in a roasted red pepper cream and baked inside a flaky crust). For dessert? A turtle pie or s’mores pie.

Some places only do a few things well. At Jacques-Imo’s, you’ll regret every dish you don’t try. You have to eat the shrimp and alligator sausage cheesecake (which isn’t really cheesecake). You simply must have the paneéd rabbit. You need to taste the short ribs. You can’t miss the blackened redfish.

If you can handle an entree, get lemongrass chicken over vermicelli. But save room for a dessert of Pandan waffle with green tea ice cream.</span></p><h3><span><a href=#><strong>Pimanyoli’s Sidewalk Cafe</strong></a>&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Barbecue</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 14241 Airline Highway Suite 105, </span><span>Baton Rouge, La.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Brisket and ribs with a side of dirty rice.

You can start with braised pork cheeks with bacon jam and then move on to a traditional Italian dish like veal parmesan. Or choose a Louisiana favorite like Pork Tchoupitoulas (a center-cut pork chop covered in barbecued shrimp). If you’re lucky, you might be there on a night when they have a 64-ounce bone-in ribeye special. That was the case on my first visit a few years ago, and someone snapped a photo before I attacked that glorious hunk of beef. And yes, I finished it and ate dessert.</span></p><p><a href=#><img width=1335 height=1133 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/06/28135548/image1.jpg alt sizes="(max-width: 1335px) 100vw, 1335px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h3><a href=#><span><strong>Strawn’s</strong></span></a></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Diner</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 125 Kings Highway, </span><span>Shreveport, La.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, but you’re here for some icebox pie.

This is not the bologna your mom packed in your lunch. It’s Leighann Smith’s thick-sliced bologna from Piece Of Meat, the butcher shop that has a formidable restaurant in its own right. That bologna gets combined with hot English mustard, potato chips, shredded lettuce and American cheese on white bread (after you ask to hold the mayo). Those flavors combine to form a sandwich that has few peers. One that comes close, however, is the Pork and Peppers, which combines pork shoulder slow-cooked with habaneros and oranges, crispy pig ear, shredded lettuce, onions, and citrus mayo served open-face on roti bread with a side of habanero vinegar. I hold the mayo on that, too. But I don’t hold back when it hits the table.</span></p><h2><strong>Massachusetts</strong></h2><h3><a href=#><strong>KO Catering and Pies</strong></a></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Australian</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 256 Marginal Street Building 16, </span><span>East Boston, Mass.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> A braised lamb shank hand pie. The Australians have it figured out. Cook savory meat into a flaky crust, but make it small enough to be eaten like a burger. This one starts with spiced lamb shanks braised until they fall off the bone. Then that gets blended with carrots, green beans and peas and coated in lamb gravy before it gets backed into a homemade crust.

Owner Gairatjan Rozi came to the U.S. from the central Asian region of Turkestan. At Marco and Polo, he’s bringing Uyghur cooking to the people of the D.C. suburbs. And those are some lucky people indeed. Big plate chicken is a chicken and potato stew served over flat noodles and known in China as Da Pan Ji. It’s basically the ultimate comfort food. The sweet, spicy, savory stew coats the chicken and potatoes and then soaks into each noodle. Every bite tastes like a warm hug — which must offer special comfort when home is thousands of miles across the globe.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h2><strong>Michigan</strong></h2><h3><strong><a href=#>Biercamp</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Meat</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 1643 South State Street, </span><span>Ann Arbor, Mich.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> This paradise of smoked and cured meats just down the street from The Big House should be reopening soon, and when it does, you’re getting a jalapeño and cheddar bratwurst and a basket of chili-cheese tater tots.

You’re also getting smoked wings. And all the meats are excellent, but the one thing you must make sure you order is the macaroni and cheese. This mix of cheddar, parmesan and Pinconning cheese with bechamel was developed at sister restaurant Clarkston Union. It is, without question, the best mac and cheese in America.

Wash it down with a two-scoop Oreo shake and then take in some of the North Carolina hoops history surrounding you.</span></p><h2><strong>Nebraska</strong></h2><h3><strong><a href=#>The Drover</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Steakhouse</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 2121 S 73rd Street, </span><span>Omaha, Neb.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> A ribeye coated in whiskey and then cooked perfectly. This place is old school — pre-pandemic, it still had a salad bar — and some of the locals will tell you it’s a tourist trap. I don’t care. That steak gets dipped in whiskey for 15 minutes and then thrown on the grill, and it tastes like something John Wayne would have eaten. A few years ago on Black Friday, I finished covering an Iowa-Nebraska game in Lincoln and realized that if I floored it back to Omaha, I could reach The Drover 15 minutes before closing time. That particular portion of Interstate 80 flew by, and I ended the night with a whiskey ribeye. No matter what had happened before that, that meal made it a perfect day.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Honest Abe’s Burgers and Freedom</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Burgers</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong>&nbsp;126 North 14th Street, </span><span>Lincoln</span><span>, Neb.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The 1809 Burger, with pickled apples, gouda and chopped bacon. It sounds odd and tastes amazing. You’re also getting parmesan truffle fries. And because you haven’t downed enough calories, you’re getting a Bananarama shake. That’s banana pudding, vanilla ice cream and vanilla wafers. Yes, they may have to roll you out of the building.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Leadbelly</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Comfort food</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 301 N 8th St., </span><span>Lincoln</span><span>, Neb.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> A burger with a sense of humor. Leadbelly is only open for takeout at the moment, and the menu is a little smaller. But they’re still serving some doozies like The Royal Mountie, which is essentially a poutine burger. It includes candied bacon, crispy fried potatoes, white cheddar curds, red wine gravy and brown sugar butter served on a brioche bun. Hopefully, a return to in-person dining will bring back an old favorite like The Full Leaded Jacket, which began its life as a joke that paid homage to the very Nebraskan combination of chili and cinnamon rolls. (No, really. It’s a beloved school lunch in the state.) The FLJ was a chili-and-cinnamon roll burger that sounded horrific but tasted divine. That’s how a joke turned into a big seller in the restaurant’s early days.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Phat Jack’s</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Barbecue</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 101 SW 14th Place, </span><span>Lincoln</span><span>, Neb.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Burnt ends, if you can get there early enough. If you get shut out, you’ll just have to settle for moist, tender brisket and juicy ribs. Poor baby.</span></p><h2><strong>New York</strong></h2><h3><strong><a href=#>Arepa Factory</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Venezuelan</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 1000 8th Avenue, </span><span>New York, N.Y.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> When this gem in the Columbus Circle-59th Street subway station re-opens, you’re getting the La Negra, with asado negro, sweet plantains and guyanes cheese. That’s probably enough to fill you up, but it’s difficult to order just one arepa. So you’ll get the Zulia with coconut lamb.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3><strong><a href=#>Breakroom</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Burgers</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 83 Baxter Street, </span><span>New York, N.Y.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> This place has become an oasis for New Yorkers serving jury duty nearby. It also might make a great first meal for someone sprung from The Tombs, which are officially known as the Manhattan Detention Complex. The Breakroom Burger (with crispy pork belly, tempura onion ring, sunny side egg, jalapeños, lettuce, tomato and American cheese) certainly tastes like freedom.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Campagnola</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Italian</span></p><p><span><strong>Address: </strong>1382 1st Avenue, </span><span>New York, N.Y.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Campagnola has not gone takeout-only, and it’s easy to understand why. To get the full experience, you need to be able to sit in a dining room that has hosted stars of the field, stage and screen and let the staff take care of you. This is the type of Italian restaurant where your server will discourage you from looking at the menu. Instead, you just trust. And out come the prosciutto and melon. Then the carpaccio. Then the spaghetti puttanesca. Then the gnocchi with pesto. Then the sausage and peppers. And it just keeps going … so I hope it can come back soon.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Casa Enrique</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Mexican</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 5-48 49th Ave, </span><span>Long Island City, N.Y.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Mole de Piaxtla. This mole is made with dry peppers, almonds, raisins, plantains, sesame seeds and chocolate and then ladled over chicken and rice. Dishes like this one earned Casa Enrique a Michelin star from 2015-17. The tongue tacos and margaritas didn’t hurt, either.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Fields Good Chicken</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Chicken</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 101 Maiden Lane, </span><span>New York, N.Y.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Maybe the best roast chicken available since Kenny Rogers Roasters went out of business stateside. The birds are plump and juicy with crispy skin, and the sides are always fresh. Get a half chicken meal with roasted broccoli and charred sweet potatoes.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3><strong><a href=#>Hill Country Chicken</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Chicken</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 1123 Broadway, </span><span>New York, N.Y.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> When they re-open, you’ll be having New York’s best fried chicken. You’ll want a breast and wing meal (and maybe throw a thigh in there for good measure). You’ll want cheesy fried mashed potatoes and a biscuit on the side. When (if?) you finish that, you’ll need to decide on a miniature pie. Why? Because miniature pies are much cuter than slices. Get the whiskey buttermilk or the bourbon pecan.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Jacob’s Pickles</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Comfort food</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 509 Amsterdam Avenue, </span><span>New York, N.Y.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Some pickled things to start. Get the hot sour cukes and the sweet and spicy carrots. Now that you’re warmed up, dive into a sausage-gravy-smothered chicken biscuit with a side of cheese grits. Hopefully you left a little space for fried Oreos.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Katz’s Delicatessen</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Deli</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 205 E Houston Street, </span><span>New York, N.Y.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The three-meat platter. It comes with huge slices of pastrami, corned beef and brisket. They’ll also give you enough rye to turn that into sandwiches. There’s probably enough there for three people, but you’re not going to want to share.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Keen’s Steakhouse</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Steakhouse</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 72 West 36th Street, </span><span>New York, N.Y.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The mutton chop. Yes. Even now. In what would have been considered the ultimate takeout/delivery power move pre-pandemic, you now can get the thick, smoky two-pound monster handed to you in a bag either outside of New York’s oldest steakhouse or at a location of your choosing within the delivery area. Of course, if you’re going to spend all that money — the chop is $62 — you probably want to wait until you can get the full experience. That said, when you realize the ultra-thick bacon is also available for delivery, you might just decide to treat yourself.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3><strong><a href=#>Lucali</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Pizza</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 575 Henry Street, </span><span>Brooklyn, N.Y.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> A large with pepperoni and fresh basil.

Meatballs tossed in Frank’s Red Hot are your gateway drug for this mini-chain with locations throughout the city. Next, you’ll be ordering heritage pork meatballs in spicy meat sauce. And then you’ll probably throw some classic meatballs into an OG NYC Hero with tomato sauce and mozzarella on white. For dessert, build your own ice cream sandwich. Wedge some vanilla bean ice cream between two double chocolate chunk cookies.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Motorino</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Pizza</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 349 East 12th Street, </span><span>New York, N.Y.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The soppressata super picante, a spicy pie with salami, mozzarella, oregano and fresh chiles. The wood-burning ovens produce a beautiful, bubbly crust that makes for an excellent canvas. If you’re in a group, everyone should choose a pie and you should share slices. The Meatball (with meatballs and fresh basil), the Brussels Sprout (with sprouts and smoked pancetta on a white pie) and the Prosciutto Di Parma (another white pie) are excellent choices.</span></p><h3><a href=#><strong>Parm</strong></a></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Sandwiches</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 248 Mulberry Street, </span><span>New York, N.Y.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> A chicken parm hero. Or maybe a meatball parm hero. Or maybe both. This place isn’t fancy, but it knows what it does really well. And that’s fried chicken or meatballs beneath melted cheese and marinara on a sesame roll. Parm doesn’t bother to do much else and is better off for it.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Paulie Gee’s</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Pizza</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 110 Franklin Street, </span><span>Brooklyn, N.Y.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The Hellboy, a pepperoni pie with Mike’s Hot Honey. Mike places special emphasis on the “Hot” in his honey, hence the pizza’s devilish name.

Now you just have to choose the specific variety. Do you order the Alpine with gruyere and slab bacon? Do you order the Cheeseburger with cheddar and ground beef? Or do you choose the Mediterranean with goat cheese, sauteed spinach, kalamata olives and roasted garlic? It’s a trick question. No matter what you picked, you chose correctly.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Uncle Boon’s</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Thai</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 7 Spring Street, </span><span>New York, N.Y.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Heavenly pig ears to start. (And they are.) Order plenty of roti (soft flatbread) and sticky rice, because you’ll need both for dipping into the lemongrass-infused broth after you finish the garlic and soy-marinated frog legs over glass noodles. For the main course, pick the jaan bangsaen, which includes yellowtail collar, giant head-on shrimp and octopus fresh off the charcoal grill. And don’t forget an order of the velvety crab fried rice for the table.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>X’ian Famous Foods</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Chinese</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 37 W 43rd Street, </span><span>New York, N.Y.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Spicy cumin lamb hand-ripped noodles. This place started in Queens and has proliferated throughout New York City. (I chose one in Midtown Manhattan for this list, but they’re all over Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.) It’s easy to understand why they’ve been so successful. A plate of those ferociously spicy lamb noodles is several degrees better than a lot of dishes in the city that cost five times as much. Unfortunately, all the stores are closed at the moment. Hopefully they’ll be back soon. In the meantime, X’ian Famous Foods is selling coveted chili oil packs and offering meal kits for delivery that allow customers to pull noodles at home.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h2><strong>Ohio</strong></h2><h3><strong><a href=#>Hot Chicken Takeover</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Chicken</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 59 Spruce Street, </span><span>Columbus, Ohio</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Two thighs, and get them Holy. That’s the hottest temperature available at Hot Chicken Takeover, which was one of the first places to bring hot chicken out of Nashville. They say if a food can thrive in Columbus — which feels like America’s test market — it can thrive anywhere. So it’s no surprise that now hot chicken is everywhere. But they do it really well here. You just have to dial up the heat a little more, because hot here tastes like medium at OG hot chicken restaurant Prince’s in Nashville. You want it to burn. Heck, you want the bread soaking up the juices underneath the chicken to burn. Get some mac and cheese on the side. You’ll need it to quell the blaze in your mouth.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Nation</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Comfort food</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 1200 Broadway Street, </span><span>Cincinnati, Ohio</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The Whiskey Bacon Burger, with a brisket-blend patty, cheddar, bacon, whiskey barbecue sauce and apple slaw on a challah bun. You’ll also want some Queen City fries. These are fries covered in cinnamon-infused Cincinnati chili and shredded smoked cheddar. This proves my theory that the problem with Skyline Chili and Gold Star Chili isn’t the concept. It’s the chili that those two particular chains produce. Put Nation’s Cincinnati chili on any starch, and it’s marvelous.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Philco Bar + Diner</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Breakfast</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 747 N High Street, </span><span>Columbus, Ohio</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> A breakfast biscuit, no matter what time of day it is. Philco is currently closed, but hopefully it will be back with that beautiful biscuit packed with chorizo, goat cheese, shallot preserves and a fried egg. It’s especially good if it’s late enough in the day to acceptably order the Philco Float (Watershed vodka, vanilla bean ice cream, Henry Weinhard’s root beer).</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3><strong><a href=#>The Thurman Cafe</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Burgers</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 183 Thurman Avenue, </span><span>Columbus, Ohio</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The Thurmanator.

I held the mayo and the tomato, but I was still quite proud when I tamed that monster.

The hardest part will be choosing which one. You’re probably driving from Dallas to Oklahoma City or vice versa. The question is how full do you want to be when you arrive? You’re getting peach.

Unless, of course, they bring back the bacon and monterrey jack strata. That is a very technical name for what essentially is bacon and cheesecake. They have fun with their specials at Kitchen No. 324, so be open-minded. Recent specials that look great include a shredded pork tostada stack and a country breakfast bowl with poached eggs, cheese, grits, bacon and potatoes.</span></p><h3><a href=#><span><strong>Tarahumara’s Mexican Cafe</strong></span></a></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Mexican</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 702 N Porter Avenue, </span><span>Norman, Okla.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Chicken and steak fajitas. I can’t explain why they taste better than most of the fajitas in America. They just do. What you won’t be ordering is queso, because it’s going to be placed on your table — free of charge — next to a bowl of fresh salsa as soon as you sit down. One of the more odd culinary quirks is the fact that queso comes free in most Mexican restaurants within 30 miles of Oklahoma City and costs extra pretty much everywhere else. At Tarahumara’s, they make sure that queso bowl never runs dry. Maybe that’s the secret.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3><strong><a href=#>Tiffany’s</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Breakfast</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 101 Main Street, </span><span>Noble, Okla.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Biscuits the size of your head.

A massive patty gets draped with candied bacon and topped with candied jalapeño, carmelized onions and a hunk of fried zucchini. Drink your dessert, but you’re not done making choices. You’re having a smoked old fashioned, but you have to pick the whiskey and the wood.

The pandemic may force more permanent changes at Sweatman’s, where every Friday and Saturday diners could plunk down their money and head to a buffet filled with the pieces of whole hogs that had smoked the previous night. Pulled pork, ribs and skins sat alongside hash and rice. And as long as you didn’t get greedy and take too many skins or ribs, you could head back as often as you wanted. But that may have to change going forward. The pork will still be smoky and full of bits of crispy skin even if it isn’t served on a buffet. The hash and rice will still be barbecue’s greatest accompaniment. They’ll still have the little cups of banana pudding in the fridge behind the counter. This can be solved.</span></p><h2><strong>Tennessee</strong></h2><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Beast + Barrel</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Gastropub</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 16 Frazier Avenue, </span><span>Chattanooga, Tenn.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The Big Katz. Pastrami gets marinated for 36 hours before it is smoked and sliced into thick hunks. Then it joins house-made sauerkraut on fresh swirl rye. Beast + Barrel offers Thousand Island dressing on the sandwich, but I opted to skip it. The tangy, salty pastrami and the crisp kraut don’t need to be covered.

The chicken from the original Gus’s is the best fried chicken on Earth. It’s spicier than you expect, but you didn’t know you wanted it that spicy. The skin has just enough crunch before it gives way to the tender, juicy meat beneath. When I visited Mason in 2014, the man working the counter at Gus’s apologized. They couldn’t fill smaller orders at that moment. If I wanted chicken, I’d have to order an eight-piece. I couldn’t help but smile. I took it to go and started driving toward Oxford, Miss.

Husk started in Charleston, S.C., and its Nashville outpost has continued to follow founder Sean Brock’s mandate that only Southern ingredients will be served. The cuisine in the main dining room ranges from a fried chicken dinner for $17 to beef from nearby Bear Creek Farm for $36. In the bar and for takeout, Husk serves a double cheeseburger on a benne-seed bun that might be the best thing on a very, very deep menu.</span></p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Prince’s Hot Chicken Shack</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Chicken</p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 5814 Nolensville Pike No. 110, </span><span>Nashville, Tenn.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Hot chicken, which blessedly finally caught on outside of Middle Tennessee. For decades, this blazing delicacy remained a regional treat. But now that this superior method of scorching poultry delivery has gone mainstream, it isn’t getting confused with Buffalo wings anymore. Prince’s invented the genre, and the origin story is a doozy. Legend has it that James Thornton Prince wasn’t the most faithful partner, and one day a girlfriend exacted her revenge by emptying a hot pepper bottle into the chicken she was frying for his breakfast. Is that true? Who knows? But we do know the resulting dish is a delicious assault on the senses. In 2017, I survived an XXX Hot leg quarter at Prince’s. If you’d like to do more savoring than surviving, choose Medium or Hot.

The Big Nasty doubles up on everything — two half-pound patties, two slices of cheddar, two orders of Benton’s Bacon and double crispy onions. As an edifice, it’s an engineering marvel. As a meal, it’s even better. The juicy beef, the oozing melted cheese and the thick, hearty bacon marry perfectly with each bite. Get fries and a S’Mores shake.

Start with three-cheese beef and pork meatballs. Then move on to the decadent lasagne with pork ragu, a mini skyscraper of pasta and pork that could be one happy diner’s meal or could start a fork fight between diners trying to share and wishing they could get the last morsel.

The gorditas served at this long lunch counter located behind a wall in a Mexican grocery store are the real thing. Thick masa tortillas are split open and stuffed with meat shaved off rotating spits. The al pastor (pineapple-marinated pork) and cheese is one of the best dishes I’ve ever eaten, and it’s certainly the best thing I ever ate that cost $3.50. One is enough to fill a normal person, which makes this one of the best food values in America. I do not have the appetite of a normal person, so I’m also getting a carne asada and cheese.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Carnitas Lonja</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Tacos</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 1107 Roosevelt Avenue, </span><span>San Antonio, Texas</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> A pound or two of the juicy, tender carnitas that chef/owner Alex Paredes has cooked in months-old lard. Paredes will then load you up with a stack of fresh-made blue corn tortillas and homemade salsa. You’ll then build your own tacos and thank your lucky stars you found this miracle of a restaurant.

Those pork ribs have a huge meaty cap at the top that produces one perfect bite on each bone. The beef rib, meanwhile, can be shredded and shared with several friends. Social distancing probably will give you more room to peruse the photo gallery of great Texas pitmasters at the front of the store. You probably will have to wait, though. On my first visit, Emmitt Smith walked to the front of the line, where his order was waiting for him. Are you Emmitt Smith? Did you rush for 18,355 yards in the NFL? No?

Many a driver on Interstate 35 has been lured by the siren call of the Czech Stop. Sweet filling in tender, flaky pastry dough tastes so much better at 2 a.m. And of course they’ll warm it up for you. Get the apricot and the cream cheese.

The Drunken Nut is a fine choice; it’s a bourbon pecan pie that goes light on the pecans — thereby avoiding the bitterness that can come from an overabundance of that powerful nut. The Smooth Operator (French silk chocolate with a pretzel crust) is another excellent option. But don’t forget the fruit.

Is it worth waiting four-and-a-half hours in line? That depends on how well you manage your time and how important it is to have the absolute best and not something that is 93 percent as good and requires a much shorter wait. If you bring friends and beer, that wait can fly by. If you’ve got some work to finish, that works, too. I once wrote a long feature about then-Baylor quarterback Bryce Petty while waiting in the Franklin line. Now, remember not to waste your opportunity when you do get to the front. You waited all that time. Make the most of it. Get enough brisket to eat now for lunch and eat later for dinner.

Fortunately, Fuego has opened next to Baylor in Waco and Texas State in San Marcos. But the students at Texas A&M still have it the best. The original Fuego is open 24/6 (closed Mondays). It’s only available for takeout and delivery at the moment, but let’s unpack that briefly. Aggies can still get all of Fuego’s magical taco creations at 4 a.m. if they want. The Dr. Pepper Cowboy (brisket, grilled onions, Dr. Pepper barbecue sauce, chipotle creamed corn and jack cheese), the Loco Pollo (flame-cooked rotisserie chicken, bacon, frijoles and roasted poblano queso) and the Dodge City Mac and Cheese (mac and cheese, pulled pork, barbecue sauce, grilled onions) are available pretty much any time of the day or night (except on Mondays).

But let’s hope that at some point we can gather together again. If we do, maybe we’ll wind up at Happiest Hour like I did on the first Friday of the 2018 NCAA Tournament. I had short rib tacos as a bunch of us sportswriters watched the games and ordered drinks. Then, after UMBC became the first No. 16 seed to beat a No. 1 seed, we’d had so many drinks that we decided to pool our money and pay $175 for the Hail Mary, a bottle of Stolichnaya upside down in a fishbowl surrounded by Red Bull cans of varying flavors and a bunch of gummy bears. Was this something we would have ordered (or enjoyed) sober? Hell no. Did we enjoy it anyway (at least the parts we remember)? Of course.

Jamaica meets central Texas in the best way at Hoover’s, which also serves more standard barbecue and meat-and-three fare. I have a tough time ordering anything but the jerk chicken with sides of black-eyed peas and mustard greens, but they also make decadent meatloaf and a gut-busting country fried steak.

I delight in arguing with barbecue-sauce lovers that their beloved condiment merely exists to cover cooking mistakes. Kreuz went from 1900 to 2018 without offering sauce. “Nothing to hide,” a sign proudly proclaimed. A second location in Bryan and the demands of cash-paying barbecue tourists forced the owners to finally relent on sauce (and forks), but just because it’s there doesn’t mean you need it. The brisket at Kreuz is cooked hotter and faster than the Austin places, but it’s still great. But the true highlight is the jalapeño cheese sausage. This stuff is so good that other great barbecue places order it to sell to their customers.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>La Barbecue</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Barbecue</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 2027 E Cesar Chavez Street, </span><span>Austin, Texas</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The Texas Trinity with one substitution.

That way, you can have that brisket and those ribs, but you can also eat some smoked prime rib. Not all cuts do well when smoked low and slow, but prime rib’s high fat content makes it a perfect candidate. Imagine the prime rib you’d have in some pricy white tablecloth place. Now imagine it for half the price and smoked in a pit seasoned by thousands of pounds of meat before it.

Or you could order a lemon bar (but still get the ice cream).</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3><strong><a href=#>The Original Donut Shop</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Tacos/doughnuts</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 3307 Fredericksburg Road, </span><span>San Antonio, Texas</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Breakfast tacos, then doughnuts. No, really. One side of the store sells tacos stuffed with eggs, bacon and a sausage. The other side of the store sells doughnuts. Why no one else thought to put the two ultimate hangover food groups together is beyond me.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>The Peached Tortilla</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Fusion</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 5520 Burnet Road #100, </span><span>Austin, Texas</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Charred brussels sprouts with bacon jam and bahn mi tacos. The traditional bahn mi (pork belly, pickled carrots and cilantro) always lent itself to the taco format, so this is a logical (and tasty) move. For dessert, you’re getting the Asian Movie Night. That’s popcorn ice cream with caramel and rice puffs. The entire time, you’re drinking Margarita De Peached (habanero infused tequila, thai basil, Cointreau, lime juice). It simultaneously heats you up and cools you down, and isn’t that what we’re all really looking for?</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Pecan Lodge</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Barbecue</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 2702 Main Street,&nbsp;</span><span>Dallas, Texas</span></p><p><strong>You’re ordering: </strong><span>You and at least one friend are ordering The Trough, which will get you brisket, pulled pork, sausage, pork ribs, a giant, juicy beef rib along with your choice of sides. It’ll cost you $69, but you’ll get to laugh at all the suckers waiting in the regular line while you breeze through the nice bulk order line.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Pinkerton’s</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Barbecue</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 1504 Airline Drive, </span><span>Houston, Texas</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Brisket, candy-paint ribs and duck sausage jambalaya. I suspend my feelings about sauce for these ribs, which get sauced near the end of the cook to create a candied glaze that tastes like a cross between dessert and lunch. The jambalaya is velvety smooth and supremely satisfying. You may also be ordering smoked wings. Owner (and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Texas Longhorns</a> superfan) Grant Pinkerton added them to the menu when the restaurant was takeout-only, and they were such a runaway success that he said he’d need to keep making them.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3><strong><a href=#>Snow’s Barbecue</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Barbecue</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 516 Main Street, </span><span>Lexington, Texas</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> An alternative to waiting in the Franklin Barbecue line that will give you something as tasty with a better story to tell. If it’s Saturday — and only Saturday — leave Austin around 7 a.m. and drive about 50 miles east to Lexington. You’ll be among the first in line when Snow’s opens at 8 a.m. When you get there, you’ll understand why Texas Monthly once named Snow’s the best barbecue in Texas (and, in the minds of the punisher, the best on Earth). <a href=#>Pitmaster Miss Tootsie Tomanetz</a></span><span> is still smoking plump, juicy briskets and tender pork ribs at 85 years young while working during the week for the local school district. When the employees working the counter ask if you want fatty or lean brisket, choose the fatty and then marvel as the knife goes into another of Miss Tootsie’s masterpieces. Get some to eat there for a breakfast soundtracked by the cows mooing in their pens a few hundred yards away. Then get more to take with you for lunch and dinner.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Sodolak’s Original Country Inn</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Fried bacon</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 9687 FM 60, S</span><span>nook, Texas</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Chicken-fried bacon with a side of cream gravy. There isn’t much more to say than that. Just read it again. Chicken-fried. Bacon. With. A. Side. Of. Cream. Gravy.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Tacqueria Jalisco</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Mexican</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 2211 Avenue Q, </span><span>Lubbock, Texas</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Chilaquiles (tortilla strips stewed with red sauce, tomatoes and onions and then mixed with cheese) and steak for breakfast. It’s an incredible way to start the day. And maybe you come back for fajitas later.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Turkey Leg Hut</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> American</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 4830 Almeda Road, </span><span>Houston, Texas</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The dish that rendered me a drooling mess. They serve stuffed turkey legs here. I’d never thought to stuff anything into a turkey leg, but I’m eternally grateful the husband-and-wife team of Lynn and Nakia Price did. Their best offering is the leg stuffed with shrimp and dirty rice and then covered in alfredo sauce. When I took those first few bites of turkey, shrimp and rice covered in that savory sauce, I loved it so much that I pretty much blacked out. It took a minute to realize that stuffed leg had left me slack-jawed. I regained my composure and finished the leg, but I’m always willing to go into another turkey leg blackout.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h2>Utah</h2><h3><strong><a href=#>Chimayo</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Southwestern</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 368 Main Street, P</span><span>ark City, Utah</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The elk London broil. Slices of rare peppercorn-and-sesame crusted elk lay atop a bed of corn jalapeño mashed potatoes with asparagus and green chile bernaise. Instead of getting an appetizer, just save room to get the churros and cinnamon ice cream along with the spicy Mexican chocolate fondue. You’re going to want both, so don’t make yourself choose.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Curry Fried Chicken</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Chicken</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 660 S State Street, S</span><span>alt Lake City, Utah</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Exactly what the name says. It’s chicken fried with curry, and it’s stupendous. Once you taste it, you’ll wonder why there isn’t a place like this in every town in America. The flavors marry so beautifully. With rice, pita and curry vegetables on the side, it’s a very simple meal. And sometimes simple is best.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Moochie’s Meatballs and More</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Sandwiches</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 232 E 800 S, </span><span>Salt Lake City, Utah</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> A sub containing meatballs in volcanically spicy sauce. When that devilish marinara hits your lips, you’re going to wonder if this is too hot for a meatball sub. By the time you’re done, you’ll wonder why all meatball subs don’t taste like that one.</span></p><h2>Virginia</h2><h3><strong><a href=#>Boylan Heights</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Burgers</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 102 14th Street NW, </span><span>Charlottesville, Va.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The Double Trouble, which stacks up two patties with American and cheddar cheese, avocado, lettuce, tomato and a fried egg. But you may need to wait until you get there to see what the B.O.M.B. is. B.O.M.B. stands for Burger of the Month (Burger?), and they get creative. In March, the B.O.M.B. was a bacon cheeseburger topped with truffle mac and cheese.</span></p><h2>Washington</h2><h3><strong><a href=#>Brother Barrel</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Beer</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 12535 Lake City Way NE, </span><span>Seattle, Wash.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> They’re still shut down because of the pandemic, but hopefully they’ll be back soon serving glorious barrel-aged beers. This is a sister location to Elliott Bay Brewing Company’s brewpubs, and it focuses on some of my favorite beers — the ones that get tastier and more potent after resting for a little while in a barrel originally used for liquor or wine. Last year, Brother Barrel released Big Pun, a Flanders-style red that was aged in bourbon barrels before it was moved to red wine </span><span>puncheons. Another beer they released last year was a Belgian tripel called Tripel In Still Water that was aged in apple and peach brandy barrels.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3><strong><a href=#>Foundry Kitchen and Cocktails</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> American</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 125 SE Spring Street, </span><span>Pullman, Wash.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> The Foundry Burger, with cheddar and bourbon bacon jam on a ciabatta bun. The menu remains limited as the restaurant returns from the shutdown, but they’re still serving the Cask and Iron, which features rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, spiced maple syrup and bitters in a smoked glass.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Jack’s BBQ</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Barbecue</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 3924 Airport Way S, </span><span>Seattle, Wash.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Billionaire beef bacon, which is beef belly cured and smoked just like its pig cousin. Except Bessie’s bacon is a lot thicker and meatier than Wilbur’s. The pork ribs at Jack’s are fantastic as well, but you might want to just see how much beef bacon it takes to make a meal.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Piroshky Piroshky</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Dessert</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 1908 Pike Place, </span><span>Seattle, Wash.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> A laugh at all the people lined up trying to get into the original Starbucks, which is … a Starbucks. Meanwhile, you’re enjoying an apple cinnamon roll or a cream cheese vatrushka from this delightful Russian bakery.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Tskushinbo</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Sushi</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 515 S Main Street, </span><span>Seattle, Wash.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Pre-pandemic, I would have told you to call (and pray they answered the phone to take your reservation) or to try to find the place — which is not well marked — and wait until a seat opened at the sushi bar. Then I would have suggested you put your meal in the capable hands of the young man with the very sharp knife. But now they’re only doing takeout, so you’ll have to pick your own sushi. Make sure to get a Marine Roll (scallop, spicy sauce, mayo, flying fish roe and avocado topped with seared salmon, sea salt and lemon). Also try the White Kabuto roll (salmon skin, pickled burdock root, bonito flakes and radish sprout topped with white fish, shiso leaf, plum paste and ponzu sauce). If you have someone squeamish about sushi, get them a pork belly donburi and then goad them into trying the sushi, which they’ll probably love.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h2>Wisconsin</h2><h3><strong><a href=#>Dotty Dumpling’s Dowry</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Burgers</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 317 N Frances Street, </span><span>Madison, Wis.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> This Madison institution is takeout-only at the moment, but it’s still serving its most popular burgers. That includes the Heart Throb, a thick patty topped with pepper jack cheese, bacon and buffalo sauce. You can also still get an order of fried cheese curds to go and make your heart throb just a little more.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Mickie’s Dairy Bar</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Breakfast</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 1511 Monroe Street, </span><span>Madison, Wis.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> When they reopen July 3, you’re ordering a Scrambler (fried potatoes, scrambled eggs, your choice of meat and your choice of cheese). Choose bacon and cheddar. It will cover most of a plate. You will try to reach the bottom, but you may never see it. You’ll still probably want a chocolate shake. Afterward, the only thing you’ll want to order is a nap.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>Paul’s Pel’meni</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Russian</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 414 W Gilman Street, </span><span>Madison, Wis.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Delicious Russian dumplings. You can get just beef inside your tender, pillowy dumplings, or you can get a beef-and-potato mix. Get an order of each. Get both with the works (butter, yellow curry, sweet chili sauce, cilantro, and sour cream). This may sound like an odd combination, but the butter and curry make the dumplings even more savory than they already were, while the chili heats it up and the cilantro cools it down. They’re takeout-only at the moment at Paul’s, so you’ll have to bring it home and provide your own beer. But I have faith you will.</span></p><h3><strong><a href=#>State Street Brats</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Sausages</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 603 State Street #1015, </span><span>Madison, Wis.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> Whether this is the best bratwurst in Madison is a matter of debate, but this is a truly wonderful place to drink a beer, eat a brat and watch a game. Or at least it was back when we had games to watch. Fortunately, the patio is open. And State Street is offering the Tourist Special, which is a pretty solid Wisconsin starter kit. It’s a red brat with a side of white cheddar cheese curds and a pint of New Glarus Spotted Cow. And if you like the brat, they’ll ship more to your house.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h2>West Virginia</h2><h3><strong><a href=#>Stefano’s</a></strong></h3><p><span><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Italian</span></p><p><span><strong>Address:</strong> 735 Chestnut Ridge Road, </span><span>Morgantown, W.Va.</span></p><p><span><strong>You’re ordering:</strong> A sublime meatball beneath a bowling alley. Indeed, while strikes and spares get rolled overhead — league night or not — you’ll be mashing up a giant mozzarella-stuffed meatball nestled in a pool of meat sauce atop a bed of pasta. There are fancier dishes, including a crusted lamb chop and a bone-in ribeye, but that meatball is all you’ll need to knock over all 10 pins in your stomach.</span></p><p>(Top illustration: The Athletic)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57kHFwbnBmZnxzfJFpZmluX2eGcK3NnbBmq6SWva2x0maboqaZo7Russ6om2afpZ6xpnnBnqqtZaChrqSx0macr52iYrKiwMSnZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
