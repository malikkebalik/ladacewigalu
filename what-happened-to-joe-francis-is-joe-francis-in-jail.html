Despite the fact that Joe Francis has made a living out of exposing women's bodies, he insists that he has done it legally, obtaining their signed agreement for their involvement in "Girls Gone Wild." According to the New York Post, in the documentary "Girls Gone Wild Exposed," a woman called Jannel alleged that Francis raped her on his tour van after spotting her in a party. She asserted, "It was as though he pushed himself on me, and it hurt.... He utterly raped me because I didn't give him my consent that night."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p></p><p class=trending-main-title>TRENDING</p><a href=# aria-label="Only Sharp Eyes Can spot 3 differences"><img alt="Only Sharp Eyes Can spot 3 differences" width=300 height=168 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img4.fresherslive.com/quiz/2024/03/spot-the-difference-game-only-geniuses-can-spot-the-3-differences-in-this-squirrel-image-65e6a303545f687150017-1200.webp></a><a href=# aria-label="NYT Mini Crossword Answers Today"><img alt="NYT Mini Crossword Answers Today" width=300 height=168 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img4.fresherslive.com/crossword/2023/02/crossword-clue-home-1076100520-300.webp></a><a href=# aria-label="Only true geniuses can spot the mistake"><img alt="Only true geniuses can spot the mistake" width=300 height=168 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img4.fresherslive.com/quiz/2024/03/brain-teaser-puzzle-for-geniuses-only-true-geniuses-can-spot-the-mistake-in-this-2-girls-65e69f8da2da711100119-1200.webp></a><a href=# aria-label="Only Sharp Eyes Can Find the 3 Difference!"><img alt="Only Sharp Eyes Can Find the 3 Difference!" width=300 height=168 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img4.fresherslive.com/quiz/2024/02/brain-teaser-spot-the-difference-game-only-people-with-sharp-eyes-can-spot-2-differences-65d828d24ed4932993717-1200.webp></a><h2 id=what_happened_to_joe_francis_wife_ class=smooth-goto>What Happened To Joe Francis Wife ?</h2><p>An arrest warrant has been issued for Girls Gone Wild founder Joe Francis' ex-girlfriend. Ex-girlfriend Abbey Wilson, 33, was accused by the pornographer of stealing $350,000 from a company to which he is affiliated. According to a Spanish arrest warrant, Wilson is wanted for an abuse of trust against Birchfield LLC in Mexico. It's unclear what the company does, and Francis wouldn't say whether he was a shareholder. He believes that her arrest is imminent, which will allow him to reunite with his twin seven-year-old daughters, Athena and Alexandria, whom he claimed was stolen by Wilson in December. Francis informed the press that he would visit his girlfriends for Christmas, but his ex had left. The couple had actually been in the case of domestic abuse.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 id=joe_francis_biography class=smooth-goto>Joe Francis Biography</h2><table cellspacing=0><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td><p><strong>SPECIFICATIONS</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>DETAILS</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Full Name&nbsp;</strong></p></td><td><p>Joseph R.
