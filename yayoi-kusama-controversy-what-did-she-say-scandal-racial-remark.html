She also enjoys art, performing, and other hobbies. Kusama’s work is also conceptual, incorporating aspects of feminism, surrealism, Art Brut, pop art, minimalism, and abstract expressionism.</p><p>Likewise, Kusama’s work influenced the work of her contemporaries, including Andy Warhol and Claes Oldenburg. Kusama has received numerous awards and has a significant fan base as a consequence of her exceptional work. At the age of 94, she is still working in this sector. Apart from that, Yayoi was previously a major topic on the internet after making a racist remark that landed the contemporary artist in hot water.</p><h2>Yayoi Kusama Controversy and Scandal</h2><p>Yayoi Kusama was previously involved in a racial incident, and many people are still curious about what transpired. Yayoi has also made several explicitly racist statements. One of the incidents occurred in a part of her memoirs in which she remembered encounters with Black people in New York City.</p><p>The statement was left out of English book translations, preventing many readers from acquiring a full, harder understanding of her writing’s perspective. In her 2002 autobiography, Infinity Net, Kusama described Black people as primitive, hypersexualized humans.</p><p>In her original Japanese version, Yayoi refers to the ghetto section of New York where she used to live, with real estate values falling by $5 every day. She attributes it to black individuals shooting at each other in the street and homeless people camping there. As a result, many of her works have gotten reactions on social media, which is something that people frequently search for on the internet. As a result, additional information is provided below.</p><h2>Is Yayoi Kusama a Racist?</h2><p>For the reasons described above, people frequently wonder if Yayoi Kusama is racist. Kusama, as previously stated, has made several racist statements. According to a Hyper Allergic article, Kusama frequently does not discuss or portray Black women, instead focusing on Black men, their lips, and private parts, gloating over the orgies she claims to have witnessed in Harlem.</p><p>Her White peers were known to create more contentious work. In 1963, Norman Rockwell created “The Problem We All Live With.” In the associated artwork, US Marshals transport a little Black girl into a newly desegregated school. Kusama released public photographs of herself being carried about in Washington Square the same year.</p><p>For a number of reasons, some social media users believe Yayoi is racist. Despite this, Kusama has remained silent on the matter. On the other hand, multiple recordings charging Kusama of racism have been published to YouTube channels. Hau Chic, one of the channels, has properly described everything, removing significant ambiguity.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/without-a-partner-lori-petty-feels-lonely/"}{"1":54}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Japanese artist</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Missing Simi Valley Rachel Castillo Husband: Who Is Zarbab Ali?
