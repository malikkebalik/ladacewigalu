Fans have been poring over every pink detail of the highly-anticipated Greta Gerwig flick since the first trailer dropped, going into a hot pink frenzy with every “genius” tid bit uncovered.
But since the film’s record-breaking release weekend, once Barbies and Kens had a chance to take in Barbieland’s full pastel glory, theories are swirling about the more subtle pop culture nods."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s so cool seeing this little reference,” one user wrote.</p><p>“Bro I would have never in a million years thought of that,” another user commented.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-style-default">Mattel and Bratz owner MGA Entertainment have been in a long-standing feud since the dolls debuted. <span class=credit>MGA Entertainment/AP</span></figure><p>Someone else added to the theory, writing that the Sasha character’s clothing give away the Bratz reference.</p><p>“Sasha also didn’t get traditional Barbie clothes when they got to Barbieland it was more trendy like the Bratz dolls outfits,” they wrote.</p><p>Some suggested that the quartet were not a reference to the Bratz but another Mattel product: the My Scene girls Madison, Chelsea, Delancey, and Nolee – which were made to compete with Bratz.</p><p>But it hardly makes sense for a characterization of one of Mattel’s own dolls – one that was made (but ultimately failed) to compete with the hugely popular Bratz dolls – to call the original Mattel doll a “fascist”.</p><p>It perhaps makes more sense that the dolls that overtook Barbie’s popularity just years after launching and contributed to a&nbsp;long-running legal feud between Mattel and MGA Entertainment&nbsp;have a cameo as the too-cool teens that make Barbie cry.</p><p>Bratz were created by ex-Mattel employee Carter Bryant and launched in 2001 as a cartoonish – all puffy lips, bug eyes, spidery limbs, and chunky feet – alternative to the more than 40-years-old Barbie.</p><p>He sold the idea for the “Girls with a Passion for Fashion” to Mattel competitor MGA Entertainment two weeks before he quit the Barbie parent company.</p><p>It took three years for Bratz to overtake Barbie in sales.</p><p>Then came&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tit-for-tat legal battles between the companies</a>.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-style-default">The movie is full of references to the life of Barbie. <span class=credit>Warner Bros.
