Rick Bos, a cherished member of the community, succumbed to injuries sustained during the unfortunate incident, leaving the community reeling in shock and sorrow.</p><p>Chandler Bos, son of Rick Bos, shared his father’s <a href=# rel=noopener>death news</a> on social media, saying, “All, I wanted to provide an update. Rick Bos, my Dad and the best man I ever met and had the privilege of knowing, has passed away,” Chandler added. “He is with us forever, in our hearts forever, and watching down on us always. I freaking love you so much dad. I will do everything I can do honor you and your legacy!”.</p><p>Born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Rick Bos was known for his vibrant spirit and quick wit, making a lasting impact on all those fortunate enough to have known him. A graduate of Grand Rapids Christian High School and a former student at Ferris State University, he found fulfillment in his work at Ventra, where he dedicated his time and efforts.</p><p>Rick’s profound love for his family and friends was a cornerstone of his character, leaving behind a void that will be deeply felt by those who were touched by his warmth and kindness. Remembered as an exceptional father, he embodied the virtues of compassion and dedication, leaving a lasting impression on all those who were part of his life.</p><p>In another social media post, Chandler Bos said,</p><p>“Well everyone, the news is getting out so you might as well all know what’s going on.</p><p>“Rick Bos had a very serious accident on Wednesday evening. It was not a vehicle accident. As a result of this, he suffered a very traumatic brain injury. Best case of survival would mean that he would require 24/7 around the clock care, and we all know, that he would HATE that.</p><p>“We made the difficult decision to remove him from life support yesterday afternoon. As of this post, he is still breathing on his own, he has not been called home yet.</p><p>“He will not survive this injury. He is peacefully sleeping now and will continue to do so until he passes. He felt no pain, and will continue to feel no pain. He Is surrounded by all loved ones. Please keep my family, and Rick in your prayers, as he transitions to the next stage of life. I love you so much dad.”</p><p>In the wake of this devastating loss, the community reflects on Rick Bos’s legacy as a source of joy and inspiration, demonstrating the transformative power of a joyful heart and a humble spirit. His memory will continue to live on through the lives he touched, serving as a reminder of the enduring impact of love and kindness within the community.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kv6qvymaZqKtdmbamv4yipWasopa0qq%2BMmpqcoZSau7V5yKdko5mdmsC1u9anZKahXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
