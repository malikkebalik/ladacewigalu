He was an experienced snowmobiler, having grown up in a small town in Minnesota where the winter sport is a popular pastime.

Accompanied by a friend, the two set off early in the morning on what was expected to be a routine outing.</p><p>However, Sheriff Todd Glander of Becker County reports that at 5:30 p.m., In Erie Township, his agency received a 911 report of a single snowmobile crash not far from the South Cotton Lake Road. The caller stated that Scott Fossum, the snowmobile’s 34-year-old driver, was not breathing.</p><p>Fossum was brought to St. Mary’s Hospital in Detroit Lakes by first responders, where he was later declared dead.
