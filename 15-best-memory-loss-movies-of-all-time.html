He soon discovers that there are more boys, called the Gladers, and they are all trapped in a maze and now they’ve all got to figure out some way to escape.

It tells the story of a man troubled with his identity after suffering from Amnesia. Peter does not know who he is and so accepts that he is the son of Harry Trimble, Luke but problems rise up when he is accused of being a communist. It’s an incredibly well made film that delivers some strong messages and is certainly an uplifting experience.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>13.

For his trip to Mars, he undergoes a memory implant procedure but here he reveals memories of being a Secret Agent. However, his memories are then erased and he is sent back home.

The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996)</h4><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=36776 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/best-movies-about-memory-loss/clje68pdywklp50zkg7mgxa73nz/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clje68pDYWklP50zKg7mgxa73nZ.jpg data-orig-size=1000,563 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title=clje68pDYWklP50zKg7mgxa73nZ data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clje68pDYWklP50zKg7mgxa73nZ.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clje68pDYWklP50zKg7mgxa73nZ.jpg?w=1000" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clje68pDYWklP50zKg7mgxa73nZ.jpg alt width=1000 height=563 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>‘The Long Kiss Goodnight’ is about a schoolteacher who suffers from amnesia and has been on a quest to uncover her mysterious past. She hires many private investigators and leaves with one of them in an ardent quest to seek out who she really is. With such an intriguing plot, ‘The Long Kiss Goodnight’ disappoints at places although the overall experience does come off as satisfying as it’s packed with some really amazing moments and also you couldn’t really go wrong when you have someone like Samuel Jackson. It’s an interesting watch with some great action moments that would surely pump you up.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>11. The Bourne Series (2002, 2004, 2007, 2012, 2016)</h4><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=1121 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/matt-damon-back-as-jason-bourne/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Matt-Damon-back-as-Jason-Bourne.jpg data-orig-size=650,442 data-comments-opened=0 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="Matt Damon back as Jason Bourne" data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Matt-Damon-back-as-Jason-Bourne.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Matt-Damon-back-as-Jason-Bourne.jpg?w=650" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/_d_improd_/Matt-Damon-back-as-Jason-Bourne_f_improf_828x563.jpg alt="Matt Damon back as Jason Bourne" width=828 height=563 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>‘Bourne’ films center around the character of Jason Bourne a man who suffers from memory loss and needs to discover his true identity. He eventually discovers that he is a CIA assassin who failed to complete his recent mission and with the help of a woman he learns about his past actions, memory loss and gets a complete picture of the story. The Bourne movies are known for their high voltage action and energy and while there have been numerous sequels that have come out over the years, nothing beats the raw energy and intensity of the original flick. ‘The Bourne Identity’ is just high class action and a complete entertainment package.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>10. Dark City (1998)</h4><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=34893 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/best-dystopian-movies/dark-city-featured-image/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Dark-City-featured-image.jpg data-orig-size=940,550 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title=Dark-City-featured-image data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Dark-City-featured-image.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Dark-City-featured-image.jpg?w=940" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Dark-City-featured-image.jpg alt width=940 height=550 sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>A criminally underrated sci-fi thriller. Alex Proyas’ dystopian thriller follows a man who wakes up in a hotel, suffering from amnesia. He soon receives a phone call from a doctor who tells him that a group of men are chasing him off and urges him to flee the hotel. The city is conquered by aliens known as the Strangers and they’ve got some frightening plans that would wreck human lives. ‘Dark City’ is a highly engaging film and Proyas’ cleverly crafted storyline and overall atmosphere of the film was a huge influence on the Wachowskis’ ‘The Matrix’ which would go on to change the way Sci-Fi flicks were made in American cinema.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>9. The Machinist (2004)</h4><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=23316 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/best-movies-with-unreliable-narrators/machinistairport/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/machinistairport.jpg data-orig-size=1280,553 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title=machinistairport data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/machinistairport.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/machinistairport.jpg?w=1024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/machinistairport-1024x442.jpg alt width=828 height=357 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Technically not a film about memory loss but Christian Bale’s character here creates and alternate reality as a result of the repressed memories of his past where he ran over a boy and killed him but decided to drive away. The resulting guilt drove him on to the edges of insanity as he created his own world in order to suppress the haunting memories of his past. Brad Anderson’s direction here is remarkably brilliant, crafting an atmosphere of pure horror and dread and Bale is exceptional in a highly challenging role that demanded a lot from him, physically and emotionally. It’s dark, tense and gorgeously atmospheric.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>8. Spellbound (1945)</h4><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=36778 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/best-movies-about-memory-loss/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-hitchcock-surreal-thriller-spellbound/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-hitchcock-surreal-thriller-spellbound.jpg data-orig-size=807,600 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title=5-things-you-might-not-know-about-hitchcock-surreal-thriller-spellbound data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-hitchcock-surreal-thriller-spellbound.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-hitchcock-surreal-thriller-spellbound.jpg?w=807" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-hitchcock-surreal-thriller-spellbound-1024x761.jpg alt width=828 height=615 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The great Alfred Hitchcock was always fascinated by the human psychology and often explored the dark voyeuristic fantasies ingrained in the human mind. His 1945 neo noir mystery drama is about a psychiatrist who has to protect his amnesiac patient who is accused of murder. The central plot of the film revolves around the unveiling of Anthony Edwards’ character who turns out to be a real mystery and Dr. Petersen discovers that he may not be the man he pretends to be. ‘Spellbound’ was one of the earliest films to deal with the subject of amnesia and brilliantly manages to portray the terrifying realities of the condition. It’s certainly one of Hitchcock’s more overlooked films.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>7. A Pure Formality (1994)</h4><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=36780 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/best-movies-about-memory-loss/a_pure_formality_still/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/a_pure_formality_still.jpg data-orig-size=1024,577 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title=a_pure_formality_still data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/a_pure_formality_still.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/a_pure_formality_still.jpg?w=1024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/a_pure_formality_still-1024x577.jpg alt width=827 height=466 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>It’s astonishing to think that the same director who made the lovely, charming ‘Cinema Paradiso’ and then come up with something as intense and darkly mysterious as this superbly entertaining thriller. ‘A Pure Formality’ follows a man who is taken to the police station for questioning after a corpse is discovered somewhere nearby. The man happens to be a famous writer but he seems to have some kind of an emotional trouble and is suffering from Amnesia. The rest of the film revolves around the unveiling of the mystery as not much of action takes place and the mostly has these men conversing but the way Tornatore maintains the tension and engages you throughout is truly amazing.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>6. The Taking of Deborah Logan (2014)</h4><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=36782 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/best-movies-about-memory-loss/screen-shot-2015-04-03-at-8-18-52-pm/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2015-04-03-at-8-18-52-pm.jpg data-orig-size=1024,594 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title=screen-shot-2015-04-03-at-8-18-52-pm data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2015-04-03-at-8-18-52-pm.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2015-04-03-at-8-18-52-pm.jpg?w=1024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2015-04-03-at-8-18-52-pm-1024x594.jpg alt width=825 height=479 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>I came across this gem as part of my research for this article and I was genuinely shocked by its raw intensity and visceral brutality. ‘The Taking of Deborah’, is about an old woman suffering from Alzheimer’s disease who lets a film crew film a documentary about her condition but things aren’t as simple as they thought as more frightening things get revealed over a number of days. The film is intensely made with raw tension creeping on to you in every scene and smacking you off with its shocking brutality. It’s raw, unapologetic and is further heightened by some truly brilliant performances from its cast.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>5. Suture (1993)</h4><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=36784 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/best-movies-about-memory-loss/maxresdefault-149/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/maxresdefault-13.jpg data-orig-size=1024,541 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title=maxresdefault data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/maxresdefault-13.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/maxresdefault-13.jpg?w=1024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/maxresdefault-13-1024x541.jpg alt width=829 height=438 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Raw, mysterious, bold, and endlessly intriguing, ‘Suture’ is a highly stylized atmospheric thriller that explores the themes of identity, memory and the human perceptions of reality. The film tells the story of a man who kills his father and concocts a plan to fake his own death by killing his identical half brother. However, his brother survives but his face is disfigured and now suffers from a memory loss. His brother comes back and attempts to finish him off again but is killed himself. The disfigured man assumes his new identity and carries on with his life. The film raises some really fascinating questions on identity and explores the inherent complexities of the human memory.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>4. Random Harvest (1942)</h4><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=36789 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/best-movies-about-memory-loss/z_rh_10_watching_the_biffer/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/z_rh_10_watching_the_biffer.jpg data-orig-size=797,600 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title=z_rh_10_watching_the_biffer data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/z_rh_10_watching_the_biffer.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/z_rh_10_watching_the_biffer.jpg?w=797" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/z_rh_10_watching_the_biffer.jpg alt width=1023 height=770 sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 1023px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>‘Random Harvest’ is about a World War I veteran who suffers from amnesia and meets a gorgeous with whom he falls in love. The two get married but problems crop up when an accident brings back his forgotten memories and erases memories of his present life with his wife. The film is so sweetly wrapped up with delicate human emotions that embrace you in its endearing honesty. It takes a poignant look at a deeply tragic human condition and subtly devastates you with its unmistakable sincerity and inherent tenderness.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>3. Away From Her (2006)</h4><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=36786 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/best-movies-about-memory-loss/960-17/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/960-1.jpg data-orig-size=960,540 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title=960 data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/960-1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/960-1.jpg?w=960" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/960-1.jpg alt width=960 height=540 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>‘Away From Her’ is a film that has the power to devastate and move you in ways you have never been before. It’s such an incredibly well crafted gem of a film that touches on the most profound of human emotions and strikes a heartbreaking chord in you. The film revolves around a couple whose happy marriage is wrecked when the wife begins to suffer from Alzheimer’s and has to move into a nursing home. I wouldn’t go a lot into the details of the plot as that would ruin the experience for our readers but the film is such a devastating look at the harsh realities of age and the human memory which has the power to bond and break relationships.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>2.

He makes short notes uses tattoos to remember crucial information he might forget. In a stroke of pure genius, Nolan uses twin structures for the film; a black and white sequence that is presented in chronological order and a color sequence that goes back in reverse chronology order. This gives us a sense of being in the head of our protagonist as we are denied the same information that has faded away from the memory of our protagonist.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>1.

Joel and Clementine loved each other but they are now separated and have erased each other from their memories using a scientific method. Charlie Kaufman examines the painful realities of human relationships using the bizarre nature of the human mind and memory. We often cling on to certain memories for no reason but they keep us alive in some ways and that’s what makes our lives worth living and life turns into an absolute misery the moment they fade out from our minds.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwqrrEppihp5yesG%2BvzqZmm52jqXquu9WinKxlkZe8tsCMppymp6Kueq270qxm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
