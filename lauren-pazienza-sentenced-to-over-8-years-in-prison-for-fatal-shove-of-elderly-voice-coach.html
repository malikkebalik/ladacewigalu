Long Island cesspool scion Lauren Pazienza on Friday denied calling a beloved vocal coach a “bitch” before shoving her to the ground — then wept as she was sentenced to 8 ½ years in prison for the heartless, random assault on a Manhattan street.
The 28-year-old former events coordinator for a high-end French furniture company was expected to serve only 8 years."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I’m just so sorry.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">AJ Maier Gustern aid after court that he felt Pazienza’s apology wasn’t sincere. <span class=credit>Steven Hirsch</span></figure><p>Gustern’s grandson, AJ Maier Gustern, said after court that he felt Pazienza’s apology wasn’t sincere — and that she only said it to make herself look good.</p><p>“She’s squirm and squirm and squirm,” Gustern said. “She just doesn’t seem like she is even maybe capable of accepting responsibility.”</p><p>During Pazienza’s speech, a grieving Gustern sat frozen like a statue.</p><p>In his victim impact statement, he cursed Pazienza and said she ruined several pleasures in his life, such as voice lessons from his grandma — and that New York City will never be the same for him.</p><p>“My baba felt safe in this city — even late at night — and you’ve ruined that,” he said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Pazienza only started to cry when she finally said sorry at the end of her speech to the court at her sentencing. <span class=credit>Steven Hirsch</span></figure><p>Pazienza was out celebrating her upcoming nuptials with her fiancé at West 28th Street when the pair were tossed out of Chelsea Park because the green space was closing, prosecutors have said.</p><p>The drunk and irate 5-foot-7 Pazienza then had a hissy fit — tossing her food at her beau before defiantly crossing the street.</p><p>That’s when she aggressively shoved Gustern, a 4-foot-11, 100-pound elderly woman. She then callously walked away like nothing happened as the grandma bled from her head, according to the DA’s office.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Surveillance caught Lauren Pazienza leaving the scene of after fatally shoving Barbara Gustern in 2022.</figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Barbara Gustern worked as a vocal coach. <span class=credit>Tamara Beckwith/NY Post</span></figure><p>Following the attack, Pazienza took the subway back to her Astoria home. She only confessed to her fiancé that she had shoved someone hours later.</p><p>After seeing an article in The Post about Gustern’s death, Pazienza became “really scared and nervous” and attempted to hide by deleting all social media accounts, removing her wedding website, and fleeing to Long Island to stay with her family, prosecutors have said.</p><p>Gustern was a renowned vocal coach whose clients included Blondie’s Debbie Harry.</p><p>Barbara Bleier, a friend and student of Gustern’s, identified herself after the sentencing as the friend that Gustern ran into in her last moments of consciousness after the attack</p><p>“What [Pazienza] said is the usual cop out for an apology. She said ‘I’m sorry it happened.’ It didn’t happen; she happened.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Pazienza’s parents — who were dressed for a funeral — were herded out of the courtroom by Aidala, neither stopping for a moment to take questions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jma3Ffoa62vsSnZKmZqp6yr8bAZqqepqSau6Sxw2arqGWgp7a0u81o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
