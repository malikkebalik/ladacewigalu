Before Elvis, his identical twin brother Jesse Garon Presley, was born stillborn 35 minutes earlier.</p><p>Through his mother, Minnie Mae Presley, Presley’s father Vernon, who was of German, Scottish, and English ancestry, was related to the Harrison family of Virginia. Gladys, Presley’s mother, had Scots-Irish and French Norman ancestry.</p><p>Presley started first grade at East Tupelo Consolidated in September 1941, when his instructors thought he was “average”. He impressed his instructor by singing Red Foley’s country ballad “Old Shep” during morning prayers, and was encouraged him to enter a singing competition. The ten-year-old Presley sang “Old Shep” while standing on a chair to get to the microphone.</p><p>Presley recorded his first songs for RCA in Nashville on January 10, 1956. Floyd Cramer, the Moore, Black, Fontana, and Hayride pianist who had been accompanying Presley on live club engagements, extended his by this point typical backup, and RCA hired guitarist Chet Atkins and three background singers, including Gordon Stoker of the well-known Jordanaires quartet, to fill in the sound. The strange, somber “Heartbreak Hotel” was created during the session and was made available as a single on January 27.</p><p>Presley was enlisted in the US Army at Fort Chaffee in Arkansas on March 24, 1958. His arrival was a significant news story. Presley walked off the bus to a throng of hundreds, and photographers followed him inside the artwork. Presley said he was looking forward to joining the military and added, “The Army can do whatever it wants with me.” He also stated that he did not want to be treated any differently from other people.</p><p>Presley was slated to leave Memphis that evening, August 16, 1977, to start a new tour. At 3:30 p.m., Baptist Memorial Hospital declared him dead. At 42 years old, he. After reviewing the data in 1979, forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht came to the conclusion that Presley had died accidentally as a result of a mixture of depressants.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Tall_was_Elvis_Presley></span>How Tall was Elvis Presley<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Elvis was 6 ft (18cm)tall, according to his official medical records.
