Those creepy ads for Quiznos’ Subs featuring two shrieking, bug-eyed, creatures that sing about sandwiches are weird and even slightly disturbing.</p><p>But they could turn out to be the most effective and catchy commercials of the year.</p><p>“We love the subs! Coz they are good to us,” yelps a tiny-footed fur-ball wearing a black derby cap, while a second one in an antique captain’s hat floats behind it strumming a guitar.</p><p>“The Quiznos subs. They are tasty, they are crunchy, they are warm because they toast them.” And then the punchline: “They got a pepper bar!”</p><p>The commercial is simple, effective and probably the most talked-about ad since an Internet company appeared to blast live hansters out of a cannon at a painted red target.</p><p>“We’re not mainstream,” said Quiznos spokeswoman Stacie Lange. “We’re more of a scrappy organization that likes to be doing things that are a little off center.”</p><p>Lange said the franchise has about 2,700 fast food sandwich shops, with 38 in the metro-area, 10 of which are in Manhattan. But that’s relatively small compared to McDonalds, Burger King and Wendys.</p><p>“So we wanted to do something humorous that caught people’s attention, and we needed to deliver an ad that was going to break through the clutter,” she said.</p><p>The ad was produced by the Virginia-based Martin Agency, but the strange creatures – called Spongmonkeys (pronounced: spung-monkees) – were found on a British Web site, rathergood.com, run by a Internet artist named Joel Veitch.</p><p>Although it looks like a rodent, the Spongmonkey is actually a picture of a South American monkey, probably a Marmoset, that’s had its mouth and eyes altered and animated by a computer program.</p><p>An executive at the Martin Agency discovered them when they appeared in an irreverent Web animation called “We Like the Moon” that was sent to the agency via e-mail.</p><p>“They’re not animals, they’re characters,” said Lange, explaining why the restaurant chain took the risk of producing an ad featuring small furry creatures hovering over their sandwiches.</p><p>“It’s not as if we’re putting a specific animal on the screen eating food or around food, it’s a Web animation,” she said.</p><p>The ads started airing in early February on cable channels, Lange said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2JlfXV7j2xmaWlfl7aoecGusbNln6uys3nQrqCzpp%2BoeqS%2BxJqrrqqVqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
