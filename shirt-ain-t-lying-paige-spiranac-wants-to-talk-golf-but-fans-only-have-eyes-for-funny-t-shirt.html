However, viewers were more interested in her risque outfit choice. The former professional golfer and influencer loved watching last weekend's first LIV Australia tournament at the Grange Golf Club, which drew over 90,000 people to the course.</p><p>The LIV tournament is financed by the the&nbsp;Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund,&nbsp;which was established in 1971 with the goal of making investments on behalf of the Saudi government and has been widely criticized for funding&nbsp;the rebel league. Spiranac is not one of those people who have complained about the event's party, which led to chaotic scenes as attendees drank copious amounts of alcohol and partied hard in the so-called "watering hole."</p><p><strong>RELATED NEWS</strong></p><h2 class=split>What did Spiranac say about the LIV tournament?</h2><p>The former professional golfer and influencer enjoyed watching the first-ever LIV Australia tournament at Adelaide's Grange Golf Club, where over 90,000 people flocked over the course's three days. "It was electric, but what's frustrating is all the takes I was seeing on social media," she stated in a video shared on Twitter that she swiftly removed.</p><p>"People were saying 'Too much music, too much fun'. When did too much fun become a bad thing?" she further stated, adding, "They were like 'OK now you're an adult you have responsibilities, a job you probably hate, you have to get married, have kids, financial burdens AND on top of that no more fun'. It's ridiculous. Fun is allowed and it should be encouraged, especially at sporting events."</p><p>Spiranac continued, "That's why we go, to be entertained. And let's be real, it's golf, it's not that serious. They are not saving lives or moulding minds. They are chasing a ball around and hitting it with sticks trying to get it into a hole. Whether you like LIV or hate LIV, you have to admit that event looked like so much fun and all in all it's good for the game of golf."</p><h2 class=split>What did Paige Spiranac wear in the video?</h2><p>Spiranac was wearing a humorous T-shirt for the video while she made her point on social media. She has revolutionized the game by uploading photos of herself on the golf course wearing skimpy tight-fitting skirts and low-cut tops. She has amassed 3.7 million Instagram followers and has been dubbed the "world's sexiest woman" by Maxim magazine. Many followers shared her opinion regarding the "fun" factor of LIV events, but some fans were infuriated by her cheeky T-shirt that read, "Not only am I funny (I have nice t*****s too!)."</p><h2 class=split>'Shirt ain‚Äôt lying lol'</h2><p>The video received a number of commets. A user tweeted, "This is in response to both the statement and the shirt. Lmaooo." Another user said, "Shirt is dead on.. lol." One person wrote, "Great shirt forget the golf." "Not sure if am gonna make it..still trying to read what is on your eyes..shirt i mean shirt," remarked one person. Another said, "Shirt doesn‚Äôt lie." One individual wrote, "No idea what you said but that is a great shirt." "Shirt ain‚Äôt lying lol," stated one user.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>This is in response to both the statement and the shirt.
