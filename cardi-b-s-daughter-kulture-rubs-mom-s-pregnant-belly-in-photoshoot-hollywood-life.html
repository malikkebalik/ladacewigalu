In her caption, Cardi gushed over the bond that her two children will share and how it will be similar to her relationship with sister <strong>Hennessy Carolina</strong>. “<span>I just know these two will love each other soo much and argue soo much since they’re 3 years apart…just like me and Henny 😩,” Cardi wrote.</span><span>&nbsp;“But one thing for sure is they’ll have each other’s back like no one else ever will 🙏🏽🙏🏽.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Cardi-b-kulture-Sweet-Maternity-Shoot-Photo-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Cardi announced her <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>second pregnancy</a>&nbsp;during the BET Awards on Sunday, June 27 by showing off her&nbsp;growing baby bump during her performance of “Type Sh*t.” Minutes later, Cardi posted&nbsp;a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo</a> from a pregnancy shoot to her Instagram account. “#2! @offsetyrn,” she simply wrote, along with a heart. Hennessy commented on that snap, “<span>IMA BE AN AUNTIEEEE AGAINNNNN” with a bunch of celebratory emojis.</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Cardi and Offset, who <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>secretly tied the knot</a> in September of 2017, welcomed Kulture&nbsp;(whose name as inspired by her dad and his rap group, Migos) on July 10, 2018. Cardi went about announcing her first pregnancy in a much different way than her second. The first time around, Cardi was the subject of mass pregnancy rumors — but there was no concrete proof. In April of 2018, she finally debuted her baby bump during a performance on Saturday Night Live , thus confirming those reports that she was pregnant.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>A few months after Kulture was born, Cardi shared that she wanted more children when the time was right. “Yeah, I certainly want more,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>&nbsp;in Nov. 2018. “I think, like, two more… But I don’t want one right now.” Cardi also applauded Offset for being such a great father to Kulture, as well as his three children from previously relationships. “He&nbsp;already has three&nbsp;kids, so I fell in love the way that he was a dad already,” Cardi told the outlet. “I&nbsp;was like, ‘Oh my god, I can have a little one with this guy. He’s really good.’ ”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Kulture will turn 3 on July 10, 2021. For her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>second birthday</a>, Cardi and Offset threw their daughter a lavish <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pink-themed</a> bash at a mansion in CA. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Grammy-winner</a> went on to admit that her daughter’s birthday was an emotional event.&nbsp;“She don’t know how f—ed up in emotions and tears I am today,” Cardi wrote on Instagram at the time, adding in disbelief, “My baby deada** turning 2 today.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH13e5FxZpyZopm2bq6MnZiun5ipsrN5yq6jra2imnqurdOeqaehpK56tLTOqKtmqJikwbB7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
