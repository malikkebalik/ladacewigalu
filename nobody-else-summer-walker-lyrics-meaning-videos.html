Summer Walker Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴  Line by Line Meaning ↴Tell me what you see in me?
Gotta be, something different
You must be made for me, patience is everything
In and out, in and out, in and out
Arguing, trifling, difficult, maybe more
I don't know, know, why you love me? (Yeah)
You got it bad, you got it bad for me, babe
All those who tried, none of them can have this, babe Nobody else but you"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The lyrics "Tell me what you see in me? Gotta be, something different. You must be made for me, patience is everything" suggest that the singer is unsure of why the person they are with loves them and is grateful for their partner's patience. As the song goes on, the artist reflects on the love they share with their partner, asserting that nobody else but them can make them feel this way. The right amount of love, trust, and intimacy create the perfect situation for them, and they never want to lose their partner.</p><br><p>The song explores the often tumultuous nature of relationships as well. Lines like "Arguing, trifling, difficult, maybe more" and "Fightin' on my mind, fightin' all my life for you" suggest that the relationship is not always perfect, but the love and desire between the two individuals make it worth fighting for. The refrain "I'll never fall out of love with you" is a declaration of the artist's commitment to their partner and their relationship.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Tell me what you see in me?</u><br>Asking for the qualities that the partner sees in them</p><br><p><u>Gotta be, something different</u><br>Believing that there is something unique about their relationship</p><br><p><u>You must be made for me, patience is everything</u><br>Feeling that their partner was meant for them and that patience is important</p><br><p><u>In and out, in and out, in and out</u><br>Referring to the ups and downs of their relationship</p><br><p><u>Arguing, trifling, difficult, maybe more</u><br>Describing the challenges they face as a couple</p><br><p><u>I don't know, know, why you love me?
