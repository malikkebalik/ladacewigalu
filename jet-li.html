Jet Li has a strong interest in the martial art of wushu.</h3><h2>Quick Facts of Jet Li</h2><table class="has-pale-ocean-gradient-background has-background" style=width:62.9315%><tbody><tr><td style=width:27.6389%><strong>Real Name</strong></td><td style=width:45.1389%><strong>Li Lianjie</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=width:27.6389%><strong>Nick Name:</strong></td><td style=width:45.1389%><strong>Jet Li</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=width:27.6389%><strong>Birth Place:</strong></td><td style=width:45.1389%><strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>Beijing, China</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td style=width:27.6389%><strong>Date Of Birth/Birthday:</strong></td><td style=width:45.1389%><strong>26 April 1963</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=width:27.6389%><strong>Age/How Old:</strong></td><td style=width:45.1389%><strong>59 years old</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=width:27.6389%><strong>Height/How Tall:</strong></td><td style=width:45.1389%><b>In Centimeters&nbsp;– 1.68 m</b><br><b>In Feet and Inches – 5′ 5″</b></td></tr><tr><td style=width:27.6389%><strong>Weight:</strong></td><td style=width:45.1389%><strong>Kilograms – 66 kg<br>In Pounds – 146 lbs.</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=width:27.6389%><b>Eye Color:</b></td><td style=width:45.1389%>Brown</td></tr><tr><td style=width:27.6389%><b>Hair Color:</b></td><td style=width:45.1389%>Black</td></tr><tr><td style=width:27.6389%><strong>School:</strong></td><td style=width:45.1389%>Beijing Sports and Exercise School, Changqiao Primary School of Beijing</td></tr><tr><td style=width:27.6389%><strong>College:</strong></td><td style=width:45.1389%><strong>Not know</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=width:27.6389%><strong>Religion:</strong></td><td style=width:45.1389%>Tibetan Buddhism</td></tr><tr><td style=width:27.6389%><strong>Nationality:</strong></td><td style=width:45.1389%>Hong Kong and Singaporean</td></tr><tr><td style=width:27.6389%><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong></td><td style=width:45.1389%><strong>Taurus</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=width:27.6389%><strong>Gender:</strong></td><td style=width:45.1389%><strong>Male</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=width:27.6389%><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong></td><td style=width:45.1389%><strong>Straight</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=width:27.6389%><strong>Kids/Children Name:</strong></td><td style=width:45.1389%>Taimi Li, Jane Li, Jada Li and Si Li</td></tr><tr><td style=width:27.6389%><strong>Profession:</strong></td><td style=width:45.1389%>Singaporean film actor</td></tr><tr><td style=width:27.6389%><strong>Net Worth:</strong></td><td style=width:45.1389%><strong>$250 million</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Jet Li put a lot of effort into this martial art, and by the time he was 17, he had won the national championship. He gave up martial arts at the age of 17 and began his profession. Although he began receiving modest roles at the age of 17, his work at the Shaolin Temple helped him establish a reputation in the Chinese film business. He eventually overtook Jackie Chan as the top star in the Chinese cinema industry at the time.</p><h2>What is the Net Worth of Jet Li?</h2><p>Jet Li, the best Singaporean actor in the world, is worth <strong>$250 million</strong>. The most well-known Singaporean film actor , according to a number of internet publications (Wikipedia, Forbes, IMDB), is believed to have a net worth of about <strong>$250 million</strong>.</p><table class="has-pale-ocean-gradient-background has-background"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Name</strong></td><td><strong>Jet Li</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth (2022)</strong></td><td><strong>$250 Million</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td><strong>Singaporean Film Actor</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Monthly Income And Salary</strong></td><td><strong>$2 Million +</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Yearly Income And Salary</strong></td><td><strong>$20 Million +</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Last Updated</strong></td><td><strong>2022</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Jet Li’s lifestyle hasn’t really changed despite his <strong>$250 million</strong> increase in wealth; perhaps this is because he never lost sight of his humble beginnings as a member of a very low-income family. You are aware that he traveled from Beijing to Hong Kong, then from <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Hong Kong</strong></a> to Los Angeles before returning to Singapore from <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>Los Angeles</a></strong>. In each of these four locations, he has a home.</p><p>He isn’t known for being extravagant. He is said to devote roughly 20% of his income to charitable endeavors. His reputation for goodwill can be determined by the fact that the Red Cross named him as its international goodwill ambassador sometime in 2010.

He’s a well-known actor from Hollywood. When given the chance to appear in Lethal Weapon 4, <strong><a href=#>Jackie Chan</a></strong> received his first starring role in a Hollywood production. Following this, he moved from Beijing to Los Angeles and continued to work in Chinese films.</p><p>He is always working on movies in both Chinese and English. He obtained US citizenship a few years after moving here, but if recent reports are to be accepted, he has since handed up his US status in exchange for Singaporean citizenship.</p><h2 id=jet-li-net-worth-growth-in-last-5-years><span id=Jet_Li_Net_worth_Growth><strong>Jet Li Net worth Growth</strong></span></h2><figure class=wp-block-table><h2><strong>Jet Li’s Net Worth Annually</strong></h2><p>With a career spanning decades and featuring several blockbusters and cult movies, Jet Li’s net worth has continued to increase over time.</p><p>Here’s a breakdown of Jet Li’s annual net worth:</p><ul><li><strong>Jet Li’s Net Worth In 2017 – $148 million</strong></li><li><strong>Jet Li’s Net Worth In 2018 – $162 million</strong></li><li><strong>Jet Li’s Net Worth In 2019 – $180 million</strong></li><li><strong>Jet Li’s Net Worth In 2020 – $205 million</strong></li><li><strong>Jet Li’s Net Worth In 2021 – $240 million</strong></li><li><strong>Jet Li’s Net Worth In 2022 –&nbsp;$250 million</strong></li></ul><h2 id=jet-li-relationship-more><span id=Jet_Li_Relationship_More><strong>Jet Li Relationship & More</strong></span></h2><figure class=wp-block-table><table class="has-pale-ocean-gradient-background has-background"><tbody><tr><td>Affairs</td><td>Not know</td></tr><tr><td>Girlfriend</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Best Friend</td><td>Jason statham and jackie chan</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Nina Li Chi (m. 1999), Huang Qiu-yan (m. 1987–1990)</td></tr><tr><td>Divorce</td><td>Huang Qiu-yan (1990)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Taimi Li, Jane Li, Jada Li and Si Li</td></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>Li Qingquan</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Zhang Fenglan</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Li Liansheng, Li Lianping, Li Lianli and Li Lianzhu</td></tr></tbody></table></figure></figure><h2 id=some-unknown-facts-about-jet-li><span id=Some_Unknown_Facts_about_Jet_Li><strong>Some Unknown Facts about Jet Li</strong></span></h2><ul><li>Does<strong> he</strong>&nbsp;Smoke?&nbsp;<strong>Yes</strong></li><li>Does<strong> he</strong>&nbsp;Drink Alcohol?&nbsp;<strong>YES</strong></li><li><strong>He </strong>takes great care of his health.<strong> He</strong>&nbsp;eats food before 9 in the night.</li><li>Many people think that Jet Li has received many awards in acting, which is somewhat wrong as Jet Li is not only an actor, but he is also a wonderful Chinese-born Singaporean film actor, filmmaker and martial artist.

I watched his movies and he is amazing. He is a martial arts master, his philosophy, his movement, both physically and mentally, were very strong.&nbsp;”&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp;Jet Li</strong></li><li>”&nbsp;I am so happy because I want more people to like martial arts movies not just martial arts audiences. Even martial arts can be used in comedy, in drama, in horror movies, in different kinds of movies.”&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp;Jet Li</strong></li><li>”&nbsp;Jackie Chan is a very good comedy/martial arts star. He does one kind of martial arts that Jet Li doesn’t know how to do and Jet Li does a martial art that Jackie Chan doesn’t know how to do. You can both go to two Chinese restaurants, but both can have different kinds of food.”&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp;Jet Li</strong></li><li>”&nbsp;Everywhere I go, I still have time to meditate. People think meditating is sitting there, nobody bothering you, but you can even talk and still meditate.”&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp;Jet Li</strong></li><li>”&nbsp;In the States, you can buy Chinese food. In Beijing, you can buy hamburgers. It’s very close. Now I feel the world become a big family, like a really big family. You have many neighbors.
