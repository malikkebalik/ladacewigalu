One of her best known roles is as Pam Beesly from a sitcom “The Office”, but Fischer’s net worth was also raised thanks to some other films, such as “Hall Pass”, “Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story”, “Blades of Glory” and “The Promotion”. Nowadays Regina is considered to be one of the richest celebrities from the United States, who has been able to gain a huge amount of net worth thanks to her amazing acting talent.</p><h3>Jenna Fischer Net Worth $15 Million</h3><p>Jenna Fischer was raised in St. Louis, Missouri, United States, but was born in Fort Wayne, located in Indiana. Together with her sister Jenna, she was raised by a teacher in school and an engineer. Jenna started to earn her own net worth at a very young age – only as a six years old girl she was already testing herself as an actress. As a teenager Jenna studied at Nerinx Hall High School and later attended Truman State University. After finishing her studies and receiving a degree Jenna started to work hard to establish her future life in the world of show business. However, her first roles were not so successful or as notable as she had hoped, but her great breakthrough was made in 2004, when “LolliLove” was released. This movie was not only directed by Jenna, she also wrote the screenplay and even starred in a main role together with other famous actors, such as <a href=#>Jason Segel</a>, <a href=#>Judy Greer</a> and <a href=#>James Gunn</a>.</p><p>The next time Jenna Fischer’s net worth rose rapidly was in 2007, when she starred in a movie directed by Jake Kasdan. The movie was entitled “Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story” and gained huge popularity. Of course, this was one of the most successful appearances in Jenna’s career, and after this amazing performance no one could question how rich Jenna Fischer is. Just one year later Jenna’s net worth was increased again, this time thanks to the movie “The Promotion” directed by Steven Conrad.</p><p>Jenna Fischer is known also as a TV star who has appeared in numerous TV shows. She made her debut on TV in 2001, when performing in one episode of “Undeclared”. Of course, this appearance did not make any huge addition to her net worth, and neither did several other shows, such as “Cold Case”, “What I Like About You”, “Miss Match” or “Six Feet Under”. The true popularity came to Jenna F. when she starred in the famous “The Office” playing Pam Beesly. There she appeared in 187 episodes of the show and played one of the main roles. This was another great success of Jenna, as the show was aired for 8 years, from 2005 and until year 2013.</p><p>So now you know why Jenna’s net worth is so huge.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=27.8132137031><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Jenna Fischer</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$15 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 7, 1974</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 4 in (1.64 m)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Television producer, Film director</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>Truman State University, Nerinx Hall High School, Pierremont Elementary School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>Lee Kirk (m. 2010), James Gunn (m. 2000–2008)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Weston Lee Kirk, Harper Marie Kirk</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Jim Fischer, Anne Fischer</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Emily Fischer</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nicknames</td><td>Regina Marie Fischer , Jenna Fisher , Jenna , Regina Marie "Jenna" Fischer</td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/jennafischer</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.375><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/msjennafischer</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0278979</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nominations</td><td>Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Actress: Comedy</td></tr><tr readability=23><td>Movies</td><td>Blades of Glory, Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, A Little Help, Hall Pass, The Giant Mechanical Man, LolliLove, The Promotion, Slither, The Brothers Solomon, Are You Here, Solitary Man, The Specials, Employee of the Month, Lucky 13, Doggie Tails, Melvin Goes to Dinner, Kiss Me, Brad's Status, It's O...</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>The Office</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=28.146630727763><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=5><td>1</td><td>Honestly it would be great to get to play Pam for a long, long time...I don't have real big aspirations to be a movie star.
