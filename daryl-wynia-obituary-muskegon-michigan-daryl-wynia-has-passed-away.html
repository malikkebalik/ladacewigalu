His warm heart, wisdom, and genuine care for others touched many lives. Despite the health challenges he faced in recent years, Daryl’s resilience and encouragement remained steadfast, leaving a profound impact on all who had the privilege of knowing him.</p><p>In the vibrant year of 1982, marked by notable debuts and milestones, Daryl made his own grand entrance into the world. Born to David Lee and Bonny (Mulder) Wynia on September 27, in Sheldon, Iowa, he brought immeasurable joy and hope to his family’s hearts and home. At the age of two, the Wynia family relocated to Grandville, Michigan, both for work and to be closer to extended family.</p><p>Daryl’s childhood was marked by boundless energy, curiosity, and a sense of adventure. He was a young explorer, eager to make new friends and share his exuberance with the world. He cherished the companionship of his older sister, Joni, who became his first and enduring best friend. Daryl’s early interests included a love for cars, trucks, Lego building, and a passion for sports.</p><p>His outgoing nature shone brightly from a young age. Notably, when he was just five years old, after moving into a new house, Daryl wasted no time in finding his bathing suit and towel and, with boundless enthusiasm, sought out neighbors to inquire if he could swim in their pools. He eventually found an open pool, much to his mother Bonny’s surprise.</p><p>Animals held a special place in Daryl’s heart, with a beloved pet dog named Snoopy. Daryl enjoyed the companionship of his furry friend, whether it was sledding in the snow or helping with his paper route, where Snoopy assisted in delivering newspapers. Daryl also had a talent for saving money, often joking with his parents that he would be the richest member of the family.</p><p>The Wynia family was an active part of Madison Square Christian Reformed Church in Grand Rapids. Daryl made a profession of faith and participated in Cadets and the youth group, growing in his faith alongside his peers. His deep connection with spirituality was evident in his frequent prayers and his knowledge of Scriptures, which he held close to his heart.</p><p>Daryl’s life was marked by his vibrant spirit, his unshakable faith, and his unwavering love for family and friends. While the time spent with him was tragically brief, the cherished moments will forever remain as precious gifts. Daryl’s enduring legacy is a testament to his unbreakable spirit, his wisdom, and the immense love and care he shared with those who were privileged to be part of his life.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwsMCrsKVlp667qq2MqJmirKWWv7p5zK6qpJ2XpLtuucicn6KfkaN6pa3RsqNmr6mjtqJ5x5qqZqiRqMCmsIyarpqxXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
