He made an interesting discovery that he could use the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">student loan</a> check he received from the government on day trading. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He started this in 1998 and began investing in multiple tech stocks. And as he was doing that, he discovered another interesting thing. A loophole in the terms and conditions of the day trading platform back then&nbsp;allowed him to leverage his student loan (worth a couple of tens of thousands of dollars) many times over. Doing this, he managed to turn the small amount into $12 million in just two years.</p><h2>Plummeting Stocks & Millions Worth of&nbsp;Debt</h2><p><a href=# rel=follow>Sacca</a><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> had built up a fortune of $12 million, but a single mistake turned the situation around. He hadn’t diversified his investments and had most of it in the same tech companies. When the stock market plummeted in 2000, Sacca found himself in $4 million worth of debt. Refusing to declare bankruptcy, he negotiated a workout plan with his creditors, which <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reduced his total debt to $2.125 million.</a> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Over the next five years, Sacca completed his law school and worked<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">&nbsp;at a law firm</a> called Fenwick & West in Silicon Valley. And when he was fired from the firm, he opened his own consultancy. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>By the end of 2005, Sacca had cleared his debt.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Chris Sacca Left Google to Become a Venture Capitalist</h2><p>Having paid all of his debts, Sacca was working as the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Head of Special Initiatives</a> at Google. During his time there, he founded and headed Google’s Access division. His projects included Google’s 700 MHz and TV white spaces spectrum initiatives, Google’s free citywide WiFi network in Mountainview, CA, among many others. He was even awarded the Founder's Award (Google’s highest internal honor) for his accomplishments and contributions. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p></p><p>Chris Sacca (Photo: Entrepreneur.com)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Sacca left Google in 2007 and began investing in companies as an angel investor.

His second investment was in a microblogging site called Twittr (which later became Twitter). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Since then, Sacca has invested in dozens of early-stage companies that have now grown into big names,&nbsp;including Uber, Instagram, Twilio, Stripe, Kickstarter, and Blue Bottle.</p><p>Sacca <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">retired</a> from Shark Tank and startup investing&nbsp;in 2017 along with his wife in order to focus on their efforts for&nbsp;healing the planet and reforming the criminal justice system.</p><p>In order to pursue his goals better, he returned to venture capital with a clean energy firm named <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Lower Carbon Capital</a>.
