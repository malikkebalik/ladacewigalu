Maria and her family had returned to Saint Petersburg in the spring of 1991.</li><li>A few years later, when the Tambov Gang was trying to take control of Saint Petersburg’s energy trade leading to several violent gang wars, she and her younger sister Katerina had been moved, temporarily, to Germany. There, the sisters’ legal guardian was Matthias Warnig, who had worked with their father in Dresden as part of a KGB (the main security agency for the Soviet Union from March 1954 until December 1991) cell.</li><li>In 1995, she had played the&nbsp;violin for a Russian consulate general’s sponsored diplomatic breakfast.</li><li>The following year, she had nearly died in a fire that had broken out in the sauna of her family’s home. Her father had found her on the 2nd floor of the house, tied a few sheets together, and had convinced her to use them to climb down from the room’s window.</li><li>To maintain her privacy and ensure that she could lead a life out of the limelight, she changed her name from Mariya Vladimirovna Putina to Maria Vorontsova. The origin of her new surname (Vorontsova), however, is unclear.</li><p>Featured Image by Maria Vorontsova / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqaYq6GRYsOwvs6nq6ynppZ8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
