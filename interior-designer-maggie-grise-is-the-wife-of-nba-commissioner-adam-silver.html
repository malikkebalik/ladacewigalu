He succeeded David Stern as the NBA commissioner on February 1, 2014, after Stern resigned after the NBA Board of Governors chose a new commissioner. Adam was chosen by SportsBusiness Journal as the most significant figure in the sports industry for 2016. He had to go quite a distance before reaching the NBA.</strong></p><p>Adam shocked everyone when he announced his long-term girlfriend’s engagement after being elected NBA commissioner.</p><h2><span id=What_took_place_before_their_wedding>What took place before their wedding?</span></h2><p>Maggie Grise, Adam Silver’s wife, is a prominent actress and singer in her own right. The NBA Commissioner is a reserved individual who prefers to keep his personal affairs private.</p><p>As a result, not much is known about their relationship. Before getting married, the couple must have, however, crossed paths through mutual friends. Before agreeing to get married and spend the rest of their lives together, Adam and his bride may have dated for some time.</p><p>In a direct interview a month before their nuptials, Adam Silver revealed his intentions to marry Matt Lauer. However, the wedding went forward as scheduled in May of that year.</p><p>The wedding was held in secrecy and only the couple’s closest family and friends were allowed to attend. Surprisingly, there isn’t a single photo of their real wedding ceremony. The fact that they have kept their private life a secret for so long after being married demonstrates how strong and enduring their marriage is.</p><h2><span id=At_the_same_time_two_daughters_were_brought_home>At the same time, two daughters were brought home</span></h2><p>Almost ten years have passed since Adam and Maggie’s wedding. Two years after their wedding, the happy couple had their first child.</p><p>The parents lavish their kids with affection and attention. Maggie was shocked when Maggie’s spouse told her in 2015 that he wanted to start a family. In 2017, they welcomed Louise Burns Silver, their first daughter, fulfilling his desire to become a father.</p><p>Additionally, the NBA Commissioner announced that he and his wife were expecting their second child to TNT’s Ernie Johnson during the # NBATogether live stream in March 2020. After that, in May 2020, the couple gave birth to their second child.</p><h2><span id=The_wife_of_architect_Adam_Silver_works_in_interior_design>The wife of architect Adam Silver works in interior design</span></h2><p>Adam Silver’s wife, Maggie Grise Silver, is an interior designer in New York City. Her career as an interior designer thus serves as her sole source of income. You may research the daily salary of an interior designer in New York City on Indeed.com, which is $73,353.</p><p>Maggie, on the other hand, is a highly qualified expert with years of experience who merits significantly greater compensation. As a result, Adam Silver’s spouse must likewise be extremely wealthy. Adam Silver, whose estimated net worth is $35 million, is her husband. The NBA Commissioner’s salary for Adam Silver is $10 million. The Silvers must thus live a comfortable existence.</p><h2><span id=Outside_of_the_public_eye>Outside of the public eye</span></h2><p>The fashion industry is well-known for Maggie Grise. Even though her husband is quite transparent in his commercial and professional affairs, he is not as truthful in his personal life. He would rather keep his personal information private.</p><p>Maggie is just as secretive as her spouse. If Maggie is any indication, she seems to enjoy the secrecy surrounding her family, siblings, and school history. Maggie Grise Silver doesn’t use any social media, in contrast to her husband, which is a hint that she chooses to live a private life free from prying eyes. Instead, they seem to be putting their kids’ needs first and making the most of their time with them while they still have it.</p><h2><span id=Adam_and_His_Wife8217s_Attendance_to_the_White_House_Dinner>Adam and His Wife’s Attendance to the White House Dinner</span></h2><p>We’ve already talked about their covert wedding ceremony and their exclusive wedding photos. Maggie and her husband, however, went to a lot of events together, including the state supper at the White House in 2016.</p><p>Michelle Obama, who was president of the United States at the time, planned the celebration in honor of Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, and his wife, Sophie.</p><p>Maggie Silver and her husband seem to be skilled at balancing their personal and professional life. We wish her and her family a long and prosperous life.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>How Does Katie George, An ESPN Sporyscaster, Get Paid?</a></strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Reuben Hazell</a></h3>Reuben Hazell estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
