Smith, who appeared on the episode alongside his wife, became a viral meme for seemingly appearing sad during their conversation — much like Michael Jordan did when he cried on camera while giving an emotional speech at his Basketball Hall of Fame induction."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I’ve lost money, friendships, relationships behind it and I think it’s because people don’t necessarily know the truth.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2020/07/200713-rick-ross-getty.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Rick Ross Doles Out August Alsina Advice While Quietly Handling His Own Affairs</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>July 13, 2020</p></a><p>After the story blew up, Smith and Pinkett eventually explained they were separated at the time of the affair but ultimately reconnected and moved on from that period of their lives.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>But, Alsina definitely capitalized on the moment.
