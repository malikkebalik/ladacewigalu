Set in the mountains of West Virginia, the network describes the show as “an authentic comedic series following an outrageous group of childhood friends from the rural foothills of West Virginia who love to dodge grown-up responsibilities and always live life with the carefree motto, ‘whatever happens, happens.'”</p><p>Here’s the Buckwild preview trailer released today by MTV:</p><p></p><p>Set to literally replace Jersey Shore by taking the coveted Jerzday time slot of Thursday nights at 10/9c, Buckwild will premiere January 3. MTV further describes the show this way:</p><p style=padding-left:30px>Money might be tight in their neck of the woods, but whether they’re throwing a dump truck pool party or building their own human slingshot, nothing stops them from making their own entertainment. Love and relationships come and go, but their bond with family and friends is always at the core for this eccentric group where anything goes!</p><p>The show sports a rather large cast which officially includes nine fun-loving youngsters, including the ratings-friendly ratio of six girls to three guys. Here are each of the cast members with photos and a brief description from MTV. We will continue to update this page with links as we find out more about them and share it with you (as we certainly will – start the countdown on the first sextape now!).</p><p><img decoding=async title="Buckwild Shain Gandee" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Buckwild_Shain_Gandee.jpg alt="MTV Buckwild Shain Gandee cast photo" width=388 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><strong>Shain Gandee</strong><br>“Gandee Candy”<br>Everyone in Sissonville, W. Va. knows Shain. Sociable and loyal, he was the high school Prom King, but missed the dance because he had to work. He’s done every job from coal mining to being a garbage man but as long as he is using his hands, he’s happy. He loves mudding, hunting and four-wheeling but most of all he loves his parents, who live three doors down.

One thing is for certain: Anna isn’t afraid to stand up for herself.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async title="Ashley Whitt Buckwild" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Ashley_Whitt_Buckwild.jpg alt="Ashley Whitt Buckwild cast photo" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=#><img decoding=async title="Buckwild Ashley Whitt photo" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Buckwild_Ashley_Whitt.jpg alt="MTV Buckwild cast photo of Ashley Whitt" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><strong>Ashley Whitt</strong><br>“The Tomboy”<br>Wild and carefree, Ashley is known for being one of the guys. She’d rather get down and dirty in the mud than deal with local drama — although she doesn’t mind starting it. She’s the bravest and most honest of her friends, but always the one to stir the pot.

She’s been chased after by every eligible bachelor in Sissonville but somehow always ends up with the bad boy. Currently a nursing student, this college girl is also a country girl through and through. In fact, her first kiss was on the back of a four-wheeler.

He recently finished up another semester in college but the flexible schedule of working at his dad’s company sometimes seems more enticing. Recently Shain and Joey have taken Tyler under their wing on a mission to make him less of a pretty boy and more of a country man.

[Everyone except perhaps the police, who apparently picked Salwa up on some misdemeanor charge back in July. <a href=#>Click here to see Salwa Amin’s mug shot photo</a>!]</p><p>And just in case you lived in another part of the country and thought you might be safe from Buckwilditization, you should know that the co-creators of the show, Zoo Productions, registerred three domains in October of 2011: BuckwildWestVirginia.com, BuckwildTexas.com, and BuckwildAlabama.com! I’m not sure if that was because they weren’t sure which of the three they were going to pursue at the time or if they have intentions of growing the franchise in the future if the West Virginia incarnation takes off. Just a heads up for our Texas and Alabama readers 🙂</p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3><span class="share-item twitterbtn"><a href=# class=twitter-share-button data-via=starcasm>Tweet</a></span> <span class="share-item gplusbtn"></span><span class="share-item facebookbtn"></span><span class="share-item pinbtn"><a href=# class=pin-it-button count-layout=horizontal>Pin It</a></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpJa%2FpK3SpmWnnaRkw6qwxKhkqaCfqby0ecyenK1lpJ2ybq%2FArKtmp5ZiurXC0maZrpubrLatsIywnKysXau2s7PIp6CaZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
