Keke cleared up pregnancy rumors in Dec. 2022 and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> confirmed that she was indeed expecting</a> her first child during her opening monologue on<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Saturday Night Live</a>. “There’s some rumors going around. People have been in my comments saying ‘Keke’s having a baby, Keke’s pregnant,’ and I want to set the record straight — I am,” she said before whipping open her blazer to reveal <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her bare baby bump</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Keke and Darius<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> welcomed their first child</a> together on Saturday, Feb. 25. They named their son<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Leodis Andrelton Jackson</strong></a>. Keke gushed over motherhood at the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2023 Met Gala</a>. “It’s incredible. I feel like I’m so much more effortless when it comes to my job now because there’s nothing harder than a baby,” the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Nope </a>actress explained to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Access Hollywood</a>. “So, it’s like now I feel like there’s so much more fun I can have and so much more ease I can bring to it, so it’s just awesome.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Before that, the Primetime Emmy Award-winner said Darius is the<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> strongest support system</a> she’s ever experienced. “I’ve had unbelievable support [while being pregnant],” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanity Fair </a>less than two weeks before they welcomed their little one. “I have a very lonely career, and also a very overwhelming career. To do SNL, for instance, is extremely amazing, but also tough for a multitude of reasons — what it means in terms of your career, how grueling the schedule is. You have to get really focused and the people around you have to be prepared for whatever it does to you. I felt the support of my partner during that in a way that’s not anything I have had before.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>“Ever since I met him, [he’s shown] a selflessness. Making sure that I’m not alone, making sure I have support,” Keke continued. “I think that’s all you can ask from anyone. And I’ve only ever really had that kind of support from my family — and it’s funny, because now we are family.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e49uZqSdm5p6sa3LppyrZZKkxqe%2ByJ6lnWWUmrOmusOsZKGhnaiyrbKMrJ%2BapZmjtG671K2doqxf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
