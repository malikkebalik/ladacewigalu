Finally, Kent founded the church after receiving a divine command to “start a church.” “Obedience to God’s word began humbly the next Sunday morning, with four people in attendance.”</p><p>But God isn’t concerned with where we start. “He’s curious about where we end up,” Kent explained. He struggled for many years to establish and run a church. He only preached to two people during his first service, but he stayed on the path that God had shown him.</p><p>Pastor Kent also has a YouTube channel called Prophetic Message, where he posts various prophetic videos. He started the channel in August 2020 and had over 158k subscribers and 48 million views as of February 2022.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/without-a-partner-lori-petty-feels-lonely/"}{"1":54}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Pastor</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Magnus Michelsson</a></h3>Magnus Michelson estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
