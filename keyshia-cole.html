When she sang on Messy Marv’s ‘Nubian Queen’ remix in the early 2000s, her music career took off. Her voice was commended for possessing a wide spectrum of R&B tones, as well as a husky texture and soulfulness, according to critics.</p><p>With sheer tenacity and hard effort, the R&B singer worked her way up the music industry ladder.
