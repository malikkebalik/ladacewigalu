He is a 1989 Heisman Trophy winner, but all of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Andre Ware? As of mid-2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $1.5 million, mostly earned through a successful career in professional football. He has been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, having played for the University of Houston. As he continues his endeavors, it is expected that his wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h3>Andre Ware Net Worth $1.5 million</h3><p>Growing up, Andre hoped to play at the University of Texas. He attended Dickinson High School, but after matriculating, he attended the University of Houston. He would win the Heisman Trophy and the Davey O’Brien Award in 1989 as the most outstanding college quarterback of the year. He set 26 NCAA records, and he then declared for the NFL Draft after that season.</p><p>He joined the Detroit Lions as the top draft pick in the 1990 season – his net worth started to increase. He teamed with previous Heisman Trophy winner <a href=#>Barry Sanders</a> and spent four years with Detroit. His best season came in 1992 which he won two out of three games. In 1994, he then joined the Los Angeles Raiders but was released after a few games. The following season, he was signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars, but was cut from the team before the regular season began. Andre tried his hand in the Canadian Football League with various teams, including the Toronto Argonauts, the BC Lions, and the Ottawa Rough Riders. He also played for the NFL Europe team, the Berlin Thunder in 1999 before ending his playing career.</p><p>Afterwards, he became part of the Houston Texans’ radio broadcast team. He later teamed up with Gary Thorne for coverage of college football teams on ESPN on ABC, ESPN2, and ESPN, before joining with SEC broadcaster Dave Neal as color commentators for the coverage of Southeastern Conference Football in 2009.

While he has been credited for his record breaking college football career, he is considered by critics as the biggest draft bust of the Detroit Lions.
