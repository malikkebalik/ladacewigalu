He claimed that he was an NRI, and according to Indian law, an NRI is liable to pay tax on his income earned in India. Whereas; the Indian tax authorities claimed him to be a resident of India under Section 6 of the Income Tax Act on the behalf of his stay in India for more than 120 days in the financial year 2020-2.

She claimed that before her marriage, she was raped by Vikas Malu and later he forced her to marry him. In an interview, she revealed that after her marriage, Vineet Malu, son of Vikas Malu’s first wife, who was an adolescent at that time, also started raping her after which she left Vikas’s home. While talking about this in the interview, she said,<br><strong>“I had earlier registered a complaint against Vikas Malu. Firstly, Vikas raped me, and then forcefully got married to me. After marriage, even his son started raping me. This was completely unbearable for me, and I left his house in October 2022."</strong><br>Later, an FIR was filed by Vineet Malu under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POSCO) Act against Saanvi Malu.</p><p>• <strong>Accused for murdering Satish Kaushik:</strong> In March 2023, Vikas Malu’s second wife, <a href=# rel=noopener>Saanvi Malu</a>, filed a complaint against him claiming his involvement in the death of <a href=# rel=noopener>Satish Kaushik</a>, a Bollywood actor. In an interview, Saanvi Malu said that Satish Kaushik has lend Rs 15 Crore to her husband for business investment, and when the actor asked for his money back, he had an argument with him on 23 August 2022. According to Saanvi Malu, her husband didn’t want to repay his debt and told his plan to kill the actor by giving him blue pills to get rid of repaying his debt. She also claimed that after investigation, some objectionable medicines were recovered from Malu’s farmhouse, where <a href=# rel=noopener>Satish Kaushik</a> partied in the celebration of Holi before his death. Whereas, Vikas Malu denied all the allegations made by his wife and asserted that he and Satish Kaushik were family friends and there were no financial dealings between them. While talking about this in an interview, Malu said,<br><strong>"Police and government are there and if I’m wrong then I’m ready to face anything. Her allegations are wrong or else she should show proof. I had only family relations with Satish Kaushik, I was not involved with him in any business."</strong><br>In the response to Saanvi Malu’s claims, Satish Kaushik's wife <a href=# rel=noopener>Shashi Kaushik</a> revealed in an interview that her husband had no financial transaction with Vikas Malu. She said that the post-mortem reports of Satish Kaushik confirms that there were no drugs in his samples; rather, he had 98% of coronary artery blockage. In the interview, she calls the allegation made by <a href=# rel=noopener>Saanvi Malu</a> about the financial transaction as ‘baseless,’ and requested her to stop to play such games. She said,<br><strong>"I request her to please not play such games. I have no douts in the matter, so no further investigation should be done in the same.”</strong></p></td><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpJa%2FtMHNn6alnJWZe6S7zGitoqORqHqurcuuZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
