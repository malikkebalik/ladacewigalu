It’s safe to conclude that her popularity stems primarily from her marriage to a super boxer.</h3><h3>Tony Ferguson is a professional mixed martial artist (MMA) from the United States of America. He has also trained in boxing, jiu-jitsu, and muay Thai.</h3><h3>With twelve consecutive victories, one of the UFC’s toughest fighters owns the record for the most consecutive lightweight victories. However, how successful has his relationship with Cristina Servin been?</h3><h2>How much is the Net worth of Cristina Servin?</h2><p>Due to the lack of information regarding professional life of Cristina Servin, we cannot ascertain her net worth. Having said that, Servin is currently cohabiting with her super fighter spouse, Tony, and cohabiting with her super fighter husband’s net worth. According to reports, Tony Ferguson, the most consecutive lightweight champion, is worth an estimated <strong>$2 million</strong>.</p><p>Tony has earned the most of his cash via his successful boxing career. Additionally, with sixteen years of fighting experience, he is presently ranked second in the MMA Lightweight Fighter division. Simultaneously, he is the most popular MMA fighter among fans. In terms of earnings, the precise figures have not been made public.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cristina-004.jpg>However, Tony undoubtedly earns the most of them from his endorsement and advertising deals with numerous brands. Ferguson is also sponsored by RDX Sports and Monster. Ferguson, similarly, earns additional money from his fights and builds to his bank account with each victory.</p><p>Tony earned around <strong>$0.5 million</strong> with his victory over Kevin Lee for the interim lightweight championships. With all of this, we can understand Cristina’s decision to abstain from employment. As a result, she is currently enjoying her husband’s earnings and is spotted spending them on luxury getaways, trips, and the like.</p><h2>Cristina Servin: Who Is She? What country is she from?</h2><p>Cristina Servin was born and reared in America and is most known as the wife of Tony Ferguson, an MMA fighter. Though the locations are not specified, she is an American national with a white ethnic heritage.Regrettably, little information about her youth, particularly her family, exists. The identities and whereabouts of her parents and siblings remain unknown.</p><p>Cristina attended Cal State Fullerton and then California State University. Cristina was also a contestant in the Mexicano Universal Jalisco, a pageant held in the Mexican state of Jalisco.</p><h2>Who is the Husband of Cristina Servin?</h2><p>Tony is, as we all know, the spouse of our beautiful Cristina Servin. Her relationship is the primary reason that the majority of people are aware of her. However, it is also true that this status eclipses the majority of her personality and life that she received as Tony’s wife.</p><p>Returning to their relationship, Cristina and Tony have been together for a lengthy period of time, even before they married. Though the pair has not revealed any specifics about their relationship, it extends all the way back to 2009.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/UFC-Tony-Ferguson-and-Cristina-Servin-Instagram-@TonyFergusonxt-1.jpg><p>Similarly, the two became engaged in 2011 and married the following year. Finally, in June 2012, the couple exchanged vows and began their lives together as husband and wife.</p><p>Of course, their wedding ceremony took place secretly and was attended by just their closest family and friends. Cristina gave birth to their first child, a son, on April 28, 2016, after four years of dating. The couple named him Armand Anthony at his birth.</p><p>They have not had another child since then. The couple seemed to be satisfied with their modest family. Perhaps this is why, after more than seven years of marriage, they are still together and happy.</p><h2>For what reason Cristina Servin filed a restraining order against her spouse?</h2><p>Today, marriage is a relationship between two people that is built on trust, compromise, and a great deal of self-sacrifice. Despite their happiness, the married couple faces numerous difficulties. Simply ask one of them how difficult it is to keep a healthy marriage. Having said that, Cristina and Tony appeared to be in such a predicament right now.</p><p>In 2019, the pair encountered some conflict. Cristina requested a restraining order against her husband Ferguson on March 13, 2019, garnering widespread media attention. She did so in response to Tony’s out-of-character actions. Cristina’s terrible conduct was justified, given Ferguson was suffering from extreme psychosis at the time.</p><h6></h6><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Untitled-design-13-1024x576.png><p>Tony also suffered from insomnia and had destructive tendencies, such as ripping the fireplace apart. Not to mention that he assumed a tracking chip had been implanted into his leg during knee reconstruction surgery. Similarly, Cristina made a statement outlining her actions following the order on March 15, 2019.</p><p>Additionally, she indicated that Tony never physically abused her or her son, but was only concerned with her husband. “Tony Ferguson is an excellent husband and father to our child. The current legal actions are part of a process to ensure Tony has the assistance he requires to continue being the best husband and father he can be while also pursuing his passion and job as a UFC champion fighter.”</p><p>She also expressed gratitude to all of their well-wishers.</p><p>“I genuinely appreciate all positive well wishes and hope that our privacy will be respected.”</p><p>Cristina’s legal team postponed their hearing on April 5, 2019, and the matter was later closed on April 23.</p><h2>Tony Ferguson, alias ‘El Cucuy,’ who is he?</h2><p>Following my diatribe about Cristina Servin’s spouse, Tony, it’s only fair to learn about him as well.
